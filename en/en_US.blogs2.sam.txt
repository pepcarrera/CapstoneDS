as for the cast jennifer lawrence owns katniss shes prickly devoted to her family and hellbent on survival she gives katniss a rich emotional life without saying a single word her rapport and chemistry with willow shields who plays a delicate startled prim and amandla stenberg who plays a quiet trusting rue are absolutely brilliant josh hutchersons peeta is seemingly earnest and adaptable while liam hemsworths briefly seen gale is dependable and goodnatured two thingsone holy crow the hemsworth men are ridiculously attractive and two my audience cracked up pretty much every time we cut from the games to gale watching at home the capitol adults are fascinating especially seneca crane the film spends some time on the actual production of the games as overseen by seneca and to see him take pride in wellcrafted murder games is a special kind of horror i should also mention lenny kravitz as a lowkey cinna who just as in the book remains the one man who connects the deepest with katniss and donald sutherland as a calm president snow as we barely see in the novel i cant compare and last but certainly not least is stanley tuccis caesar flickerman to quote cleolinda jones yeah my review is essentially a ditto of hers he manages just the right combination of complicit outrageous compassionate fake and sincere its truly an incredible amount of talent and hard work on display here which to be totally honest i never expected out of an adaptation of this novel well done everyone well done

as the bridge book in this trilogy underworld does not disappoint oftentimes the second book is considered the filler and often riddled with unnecessary plot lines to extend a series but underworld is quite the opposite if anything this book has just built this story up to a perfect climax leaving the reader at the edge and ready to crash down to an incredible conclusion be prepared to be completely blown by this book and fall even harder for the king of the underworld

im sure im not alone when i say this but i really wanted to launch my own radio station after i saw pump up the volume a shimmering glob of underrated awesomeness one that fought for your undivided attention twenty years ago but got lost in the overcrowded realm that was teen angst cinema of course nowadays the idea of broadcasting a pirate radio show from the moldy jizzstained confines of your parents basement might seem a tad quaintespecially in a world dominated by social media and reality televisionbut in it was groundbreaking stuff seriously a disaffected teen as the catalyst for change wasnt that farfetched during a time when apathy and yuppie culture had infected the general populace spouting a crude yet compelling melange of saucy malapropisms on the radio complimented by an eclectic array of rap punk pop and leonard cohen a properly motivated adolescent in a bowling shirt could inspire the alienated and the downtrodden hovering around their speakers to do his or her bidding and do so with an alarming ease it didnt matter if person doing the talking originally intended to shake things up your voice was singled out as the champion for those being buttsurfed by the system whether you like it or not my pirate radio station for example would have been an eardestroying cacophony of postindustrial sex music and italo disco with weather and fashion updates on the hour in other words while my stations chic temperament would never be in doubt its seemingly innocuous content wouldnt cause the shady bureaucrats who the run local high school to loose any sleep the radio station featured in this film on the other hand oozes of subversion from every pore

author suzanne collins writes the entire series from the point of view of katniss everdeen while this typically works and makes for a relatively interesting story overall when tied in with collins limited writing chops it severely handicaps character development in many of the secondary characters besides katniss gale and peeta all the other characters are developed only rudimentarily with little to no backstories this took me emotionally out of some scenes as it was difficult to get invested and relate to such underdeveloped characters

as many nation states as well as supranational governing bodies eg the european commission fail to address these realities and challenges in a convincing and comprehensive way and also because of the regionalocal specificity of problems and challenges we are now witnessing the rapid rise of periurban regions engaged in developing rural development strategies eg the purple network and cities eg london amsterdam rotterdam designing and implementing their own food strategies although i am strongly in favour of the subsidiarity principle i do believe that localegional initiatives can develop more efficient and effective when they fit within a broader policy framework at supranational level in that respect i think that it would be favourable if the ongoing cap reforms ultimately result in a disappearance of the cap and the appearance of two new policy frameworks arising out of the cap a common regional policy crp focusing on the sustainable development of regions encompassing both urban and rural areas and a common food policy crp addressing the multidimensionality health environment equity employment etc of food a crp would require a merger of current rural and regional development policies and thus the integration of dg regional policy and the rural development part of dg agriculture and rural development whereas a cfp would be based upon an integration of policies in the domains of agriculture health consumer protection environment transport social affairs and equal opportunities i am fully aware that this is utopian at this moment yet in the longer run the notions of crp and cfp may serve as a guideline for further policy reforms

war is unpleasant and the iraq war more unpleasant than most given its falsified justification and mismanagement but de palmas usual talent for immersion in seediness fails him here he does not capture the repulsion of war he only makes a repulsive film as if to ward off the pointlessness of the exercise de palma has his characters occasionally spout aesthetic maxims when salazar jokingly tells mccoy that his camera doesnt lie mccoy replies thats bullshit because thats all that camera ever does later salazar more insistently urges just because you watch it doesnt mean youre not a part of it naturally both of these utterances are key positions of de palmas entire approach and philosophy but so hear them said aloud here cheapens them especially the latter quote de palma is a master of implicating his audience up there with alfred hitchcock and michael haneke but this film does not implicate anyone because it is so morally rigid casualties of war shows a situation slowly spiraling off its axis until the breaking point isnt visible these men broke before they even left home what then can we learn of them

it has a nice light texture and has that adorable smell that some of their other skincare products have i am thinking in particular of the express flower gel which i was lucky enough to get from my sis a couple of years back anyway its not like putting on a tanning product at all a good thing having said that it is so light in texture that i felt the need to apply a second layer of moisturiser over the top the colour is pretty subtle and only started coming out after the second application it suggests applying twothree times a week and id probably go for three all in all very pleasing i hadnt used a face tan for a while so was quite tentative but soon realised this was a subtle product in every way smell texture and colourwise a real treat to use for which many thanks

you dont become a cook and change right away its a metamorphosisit takes time for some people a lot of time theres usually a great deal of mental and physical trauma involved at a certain point a cook comes to realize that they are not sailing on a pirate ship doing fuck all seeing that this is not a partysome creative culinary orgy involving loose waitresses booze and tough guy posturing usually sends most folks running back to the cubicle for others its something as simple as the first turn on a busy night a bewildered look coupled with a soaked chefs coat followed by a two weeks notice maybe catering is a better choice

what would you say is the sexiest part of female anatomy if you said eyebrows what the fuck is wrong with you why would you say that im getting the willies just thinking about what kind of person would choose eyebrows as the sexiest the image of them cowering naked in some nondescript basement surrounded by posters of women with robust eyebrows is so vivid so real that i can practically taste the unplucked awkwardness on my chapped lips however if youre able to admire a tastefully orchestrated closeup of a womans eyebrows and surrounding eye region every now and then and are not a complete weirdo about it youll definitely enjoy the new york ripper lucio fulcis grisly tribute to misogyny and downtown homicide wait a minute did you say grisly tribute why yes i did you see in order to savour the eyeflavoured camera work in this film youre also gonna have to endure a fair amount of ghastliness its what we in the eyebrow appreciation business call a tradeoff let me put it this way noone in their right mind is gonna allow someone to make a movie solely about eyebrows and noone in their right mind is gonna allow someone to make a movie solely about murder this manhattan set slasher film attempts to strike a balance between the two subjects by giving the bloodthirsty sickos in the audience the overthetop carnage they so wantonly crave while at the same time throwing a bone to the eyebrow crowd and in that regard i think this film will definitely silence the critics out there who think extreme gore and eyebrow fetishism cant coexist with one another

it is clear in the departed that costello although he is a mob boss acts as a father figure to both characters as well as queenan is to costigan however it is evident that costellos aims and desires for both characters only benefit his organization while queenan has a rightmind to not only put costello into prison but also to protect costigan police corruption is perhaps the main theme of the screenplay and coincides well with the concept of identity both costigan and sullivan must maintain their false identities but must also make sure it does not get to them not only is this picture a wonderful thriller full of action it also reflects on the idea of police corruption a fatherson relationship and the idea of identity

the political dynamic surrounding the payroll tax cut has now evolved in such a way that neither party wants to be blamed for its expiration so it will likely be extended even though it has now become almost a perfect storm of policy mistakes its ultratemporary nature undoes virtually all of the positive stimulus impact claimed for it while the adverse effects include high policy uncertainty undercutting budget transparency increased fiscal pressure and lasting damage to social securitys financial and political foundation this last of which may well prove irreparable

reading over these reasons i can see clearly why i never wanted to go on a break all of these reasons make the parties involved with the break seem weak theyre too afraid to make a final decision so they want to leave the door open for the possibility of getting back together but theyre not entirely sure thats what they want its very wishywashy and noncommittal and it just doesnt seem like it makes any sense to sensible people

there are a few neurological examinations of deja vu that are a little bit better about explaining it but still nothing groundbreaking basically its been noted that it can occur frequently in people experiencing some form of pathological mental disorder there are frequent reports of deja vu experiences in epileptics and because epileptics are one of the few groups of people whose brains we can jam electrodes into in the name of science there are a few reported findings of induced dreamy states that are similar to deja vu during some stimulations of the temporal cortex of course its entirely possible that these deja vulike states experienced in pathological patients bear only a surface resemblance to actual deja vu in the way that visual hallucinations arent caused by the same phenomena as actual vision then there are more of those asynchronicity explanations only with neurological pathway replacing process at least these have some better surface validity though i can see where its possible that two pathways for sensory information might split into a sort of double vision of course that explanation doesnt match the subjective experience at all because people experience all sensory perception during deja vu as occurring simultaneously as normal the two pathway explanation loses a lot if it becomes the really intricately timed pathways explanation theyre all so frigging general though slowed transmission something going wrong during a seizure etc so again yes maybe the function of the brain might affect an experience we have somehow good job guys

there are several ways of transferring heat from one place to another today i will be focussing on conduction between two solids or bodies conduction can be described as a way to transfer energy within and between bodies of matter these bodies of matter or just your body are made up of tiny particles that vibrate more and more as you heat them think of it as reaching for an object which you didnt know was hot you immediately let go and wave your hand in misery these particles also wave or vibrate and pass this motion on to other particles they collide with so heat tends to move towards a colder area because the particles play tag from one end to the other

on my second day in iceland i went horseback riding the icelandic horse is a fascinating animal my horse was long nose i know how to say it in icelandic but have no idea how to write it he was beautiful a great horse but a wee bit stubborn he liked riding a little too close to the edge of sloped roads at least too close for my tastes it didnt bother me at first but then some of the horses would get too close to each other and once one started to trot the others would follow and that led to overcrowding and pushing it wasnt anything super dangerous but i wasnt comfortable with it so id steer long nose away from the edge or just slow him down he wasnt having it the first few times i tried to steer him but i wasnt having it either so i persisted in steering him away from the edge and then he started to listen after a while it dawned on me that id grown two years ago i would have given up and let that horse do whatever it wanted but instead i made my comfort level a priority and gave consideration to my instincts i dont know when it happened but somewhere in the last few months id gotten confident and now riding through the icelandic countryside i could clearly see that confidence i literally sat up straighter in my saddle and smiled during the course of the ride there were a few more stubborn moments with long nose and there were a handful of times that he did get his way im copping it up to the fact that he is a viking horse but he was a still a great horse and i really wouldnt have wanted any other horse but him

note this blog has watched all gop candidates closely and has actively supported the gingrich candidacy based on policy and the fact that one would pay to see that man debate obama given he had sufficient sleep however he was so badly damaged by mitt romneys negatives and his lackluster debate performance before the florida primaries with subsequent primary loses and made his candidacy no longer viable in this opinion however the stronger performances of rick santorum and specifically his economic and foreign policy stands made him the most viable of all candidates when combining the ability to win a general election the legislation hat he produced that was consistent in regards to his state therefore he represented the people who hired him and finally the superficial he is the youngest photogenic candidate for those who vote solely on the american idol ticket the defining moment was his shot at both romney and gingrich during the florida debate as a fan of the former speaker especially for the work he did during the clinton presidency one can only hope these rumors are unfounded and that the speaker understands its time to take one for the nation not the team

after i had calmed down and got some sleep i had some more perspective on the movie there are it occurs to me a few very important differences between that movie and my life one of these vital differences is that tyler has never claimed that maybe he deserved to be selfish as violet does in the movie so i have always felt like i could tell him if i needed things to change and he would help make things better we strive to find things to do that will make both of us happy not just one of us we also continue to spend time together going on dates regularly and taking care of our relationship it comes first sometimes tyler comes home early from building the house and drags me out to canoe around the lake or we go for a long walk together

now what inference may be drawn from this amending of section only of commonwealth act no by commonwealth act no the logical conclusion is that in promulgating commonwealth act on june the national assembly all along regarded commonwealth act no which delegated legislative powers to the president as still in force and effect despite the report filed with the assembly by the president at the beginning of its regular session in january when the legislature merely amends a section of a law leaving the rest of said law intact and unchanged the logical inference and conclusion is that the amended law was still in force because you cannot amend a law which is no longer in force the only thing that could be done with a law that has ceased to operate is to reenact it but in passing commonwealth act in july the assembly did not reenacted commonwealth act no by merely amending one of its sections the assembly as late as june considered said act as still effective and in operation and consequently the emergency powers of the president continued and subsisted despite his previously having made a report of his actions in january this squarely refutes the theory that as soon as the president filed his report on the exercise of his emergency powers with the legislature the act making the delegation ceased to operate and the president lost his emergency powers

with this relocation comes a new sound too a further excursion into mounts fascinating brain the restless pace of s nights out is tempered with frequent moments of calm and the insistent top layer of squelchy falsetto replaced with more modest lithe hooks she wants is newly sentimental adding a personal touch to the more generalised feelings the songs had previously explored while everything goes my way has a female lead vocal and the glamour of a john hughes film from the s the latter is deliciously summery but one of the albums weakest for how uncompelling its structure is

little miss paige is growing up so darn fast she practically runs all over now she is starting to talk and babble but tells us what she wants even though she cant say many words yet she is now months old after many months of struggling with this baby and thinking that the future would hold a very difficult baby she has turned into quite an easy child she has so much character already she definitely knows what she wants she also tends to be a fast learner she loves to take a bath and if we say the word bath she heads to the bathroom and waits for you to start the bath water and then grabs her towel and jammies and heads to our room to get naked she has learned so much in the last few months i am just amazed at her every day she loves to be tickled and will tickle you back if we mention that its time to eat she heads straight to the highchair and waits for you to put her in it and give her her food if we say that we are going byebye she will head to the kitchen to get her coat and shoes on and after many months of struggling to get her to nap or sleep at night she now will grab her blankie and lay down if she is tired and when put to bed she sleeps all through the night so maybe all my complaining paid off or maybe i just wasnt patient enough for the easy time to come but it is here now and i am trying to enjoy every second of it she is definitely a blessing sent to us

the story line is based on three main characters basil hallward dorian gray and lord henry wotton basil is dorians closest friend at the beginning who paints a portrait of him and has a sort of obsession with his beauty and perfection lord henry an arrogant self moralized individual cant wait to meet him but basil is afraid that he would corrupt him and so he did we learn as the novel progresses the moment lord henry meets dorian he somehow manages to change the naive young mans entire perspective and attitude towards life and people he manages to persuade dorian to sell his soul for eternal youth and beauty and thrive on pleasure without the conciseness of good and evildorian distances himself from basil who gave him the portrait as a gift and continues to be influenced by lord henry a number of events contribute to dorians downfall where he exhausts his advantages of eternal youth and beauty without any consequences however the consequences do somehow catch up with him as leaves ugly marks on his portrait where the reader soon assumed is his soul and conscious he hides the portrait but after some serious events involving the death of some characters he decides he wants to be good again and destroys the painting killing himself in the process all thats left is the former beautiful painting that was made at the start with dorian having paid the consequences

the nba playoffs are underway and ive been reading a lot of underlying stories that could take place given certain circumstances will lebron finally get his first elusive ring will tim duncan and gregg popovich upgrade their legacy by grabbing their th title together can the bulls win without former mvp derrick rose can kobe get his th ring and finally catch up to michael jordan that last one is the one that bugs me the most and has been for several years now there is no question kobe bryant wants to be compared to jordan if not surpass him when it comes to their ring collection does kobe winning a th ring make it fair to evaluate kobe on an even playing field with jordan does rings for both men mean they are equal superstars is kobe really being compared to being the next jordan i mean all rings aside the two arent even in the same league ive heard it all too kobe had developed a better jumper earlier in his career than jordan did kobe this and kobe that im not saying everybody actually believes kobe could be considered an equal or even better than jordan but the media seems to like to compare the two when really there is no comparison at all the only thing kobe has over jordan is the number on his jersey

o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith

the vampires in shiver are particularly interesting when we first meet them they are sympathetic and even kind of goofy the scene where the young couple first sits down to dinner with isles cousins is hilarious the two men giving this longwinded lecture on their studies constantly posturing interrupting each other and ending each others sentences the two actors play off each other beautifully however as the two vampires come to accept and even embrace their new nature they become less sympathetic and more monstrous when we reach the point just before the climax when all masks are dropped and they are lecturing antoine on how he should be feeling pity for them instead of anger i rather find them downright repulsive

so lets try this again lets get the thoughts out the scary and the insecure the rotten and shameful and let the moment pass as it should get it out and see how it feels i have prided myself in being fully committed in all i choose to do with the exception of this and i hide from the people who love and rely on me the most especially myself so i will commit to this in the same way i will make my words come out learn to see that the value is not in how i can be first because of the noise i made but that i can be heard because of the words i choose

i hope that the protags main rebellion in brave is not that she actually wants to pick who she marries whoohoo can you imagine that being the main plot of movie starring a male or that the protag has to pretend to be male in order to have adventures why do little girls have to see that so much girls can do anything boys can do that is so patronizing ugh girls dont even know about sexism yet for gods sake when my daughter was four and saw mulan she was confused and asked me why cant girls fight i had to explain sexism so she could understand the plot of the movie

this is it this is christmas right here cribs and static nativity scenes go back at least as far as the th century and the more i look at this one the stranger it begins to seem theres nothing new in devotees producing statues and figurines to illustrate their gods and goddesses but whats startling about the christmas scene is its very ordinariness theres nothing magic here only scruffy badlydressed people sharing a stable with some rather surprised looking animals but at once its something even the poorest can relate to louis xivs peasants mightnt have seen much of the goose and even less of the presents but they could see and believe in this scene and they could participate in it too france is still famous for its santons the little terracotta figures of saints and holy figures produced at least as far back as the th century and now a thriving specialized industry in provence

house of the devil may ultimately be nothing more than a genre exercise but it would be unfair to dismiss it because of that it is indeed a very particular kind of genre exercise one where the audience and the artist must both have the same knowledge of the subject matter in order for the effect to be fully realized west in many ways is like the glenn gould of horror filmmakers sure one can listen to and enjoy the goldberg variations but its not until you listen to someone else play it that you realize the true genius of his work

amy had a little bit of experience with growing vegetables last year but we did start late and we did buy plants from garden centres so after planting our courgettes out we were harvesting them in weeks when you have to plant the seeds yourself in february march and april and drag yourself up to the allotment on the rainiest of rainy days to water the seedlings in the greenhouse it can be quite a chore to focus on the long term goals
so hurry right out and buy one of those teeny tiny little cars that those environmentalists say we need to have you know those that wont go very far so you wont be able to travel anymore and while you are at it be sure and notice our landscape being covered up with windmills so we can capture the wind so we wont run out of electricity either of course this is because we are going to run out of oil and gas to run our generators and we all need to cut down on electricity use too oh dear what will we do what will we do chicken little is running around the barnyard wringing her hands because the world is going to crash any moment at least it is according to those environmentalists who make up all these stories all the time anyway

even funnier is the fact that the whole time traveling set up is run by a guy on a wheel chair that looks like a zombie everyone standing around looks more adequate for the job than this guy who looks like he has one foot in the grave want more funny okay here it goes they can see the past like a movie on a little tv screen they have walkytalkies with which they can communicate through time this means somebody that is in the past can actually talk with someone from the future so we have audio waves that travel through time as well ha there is this really funny sequence in which louise travels back to the future and after she walks through the time portal an invisible force fixes the bed of the hotel she was staying in because you know its not polite to leave a room untidy after time travel point is there are a lot of goofy situations and plot holes on this one you can have fun simply by going through them as you watch the film
but if something dreadful had happened to you would you want it splashed across the pages of a national magazine i can see why you might if the money the magazine paid you for your story was for charity but some of the stories in these magazines leave me thinking why people do it well for the money i guess or of course writing about what happened can work as therapy it can also serve as a warning to others this happened to me dont let it happen to you im not sure id do it no matter how much they paid could i write about something horrific that happened to someone i know with their consent either the answer would probably be no it takes all kinds of writer to write all kinds of things maybe youre different and could write a piece like that its something to think about

that was the first time that i realized i was supposed to help people it sounds cheesy but i have always had not just an urge but a need to help others and usually an action plan when i was in fourth grade i wrote a paper about what i wanted to be when i grew up and i put an attorney so i can help people i dont think i even knew what attorneys did thats just always what my parents had told me i was going to be but i knew that i wanted to do something important that would make an impact on people at i realized i wanted to be a nurse but the timing was all kinds of wrong my dad had passed away my mom had all but abandoned me she moved miles away and didnt speak to me for two years and my sister and i were left to run a business that was not either of our dreams but it was what we had to do a lot of times i think about that part of my life and wish things were different i picture myself going away to school like everyone else living in a shitty dorm somewhere and eating ketchup packets for lunch because i cant afford the cafeteria food and not having all the responsibilities of a grown adult when i was still a kid but as they say it is what it is

in the last year hop prices have decreased significantly in particularly us varieties now making it financially viable to dry hop beers without increasing costs significantly this is great news for craft beer in britain as it allows us as brewers to increase the quality of the finished product the brewers dilemma is at what point is a beer of sufficient quality whilst still remaining profitable it simply boils down to simple economics if a commodity is cheaper we can use more whilst still being competitive on price so with one eye on i for one am excited at the prospect of using bale after bale of us green goodies to dry hop more of our beers give them that wow factor

anyway i was listening to the radio and was surprised to hear that while some people live in dread of impending home foreclosures others are impatient with the banks for not foreclosing on their homes quickly enough why because the value of their home has dropped so significantly that they do not want to pay their mortgage anymore theyd rather let the bank take the property so they can buy a similar home at a fraction of the cost
ive been trying to prepare more food at home to avoid ordering food at work i came to this decision when i realised id eaten mcdonalds four times one week mcdonalds and kfc deliver here and they have english language order lines that can tell where you are by locating the phone so you dont need to know the chinese address which means that all us foreign trainers use it a lot as its something we can do ourselves instead of having to get our chinese coworkers to do it for us im not going super hardcore with it as i cant really read the nutritional info and the ones that actually have info only show kilojoules instead of kilocalories so its more a case of trying to make the best choices of what im offered i can be difficult when you cant read menus to find something reasonable so things have been a bit hit or miss but i dont want to stop eating out with people as the social aspect is really important its so easy to become isolated here and i dont want that to happen

not true in this case while this episode is clearly a robin episode through and through the episode also gives just as much attention to the team as a whole showing the amount of camaraderie theyve built up after the number of missions and drama theyve gone through each of them really cares for each other and has each others back not just in a teammate sense but in a family sense which is especially brought home by the fact that the team is undercover as a family
i have been praying the prayer of jabez for years that god would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that god would keep his hand on me and keep me from evil that i might not cause pain i dont believe this prayer has been in vain because my website has now reached views and god has hopefully increased my sphere of influence with the publishing of my book i have certainly been blessed and my territory has certainly been enlarged more than i ever thought possible god has kept his strong hand of mercy on me throughout my life and has certainly kept me from doing evil on several occasions though in my humanness i certainly wanted to if you have not read the classic book the prayer of jabez i highly recommend it as it is one of the best books ive read and its premise was one of the great spiritual steppingstones in my life

we are familiar with the practice and routine of enacting laws a bill is introduced in the legislature it is referred to the corresponding committee it is studied by said committee which in some cases holds public hearings the committee discusses the bill and sometimes introduces amendments if the bill is not killed in the committee or shelved it is submitted to the chamber for study discussion and possible amendment by all the members it is finally voted and if approved it is sent to the other house where it undergoes the same process and if it is finally approved by both houses of congress it is submitted to the chief executive for his study and approval or veto all these may consume weeks or months as a result of which ordinarily many bills finally approved by the congress could be sent to the president for approval or veto only after adjournment of the legislative session and we should not overlook the fact that in some cases for lack of time of due to disagreement among the legislators or between the two houses of congress important pieces of legislations like the annual appropriation law for the fiscal year appropriation of funds for the election to be held in november contained in executive orders nos and involved in the present cases and the proposed amendment to the election code etc have not been passed by congress in its last session ending last may which session lasted one hundred days if we were to rely on the ordinary process of legislation to meet a national emergency by the time the necessary and needed law is passed the situation sought to be remedied or the problem sought to be solved may have become disastrous or ended in calamity or gone beyond legislation or any remedy it would be too late it would be like locking the stable door after the horse had been stolen

another interesting thing to note is how much more textheavy the older picture books were than ones published today a friend who attended a childrens writing conference last weekend said the editor who spoke recommended no more than words for a picture book text i wonder if the push for shorter and shorter texts for pretty much all picture books has contributed to the decline in their sales as the new york times noted recently many parents are pushing their kids to listen to chapter books at earlier and earlier ages maybe they would feel less need to do so if they had meaty complex picture books like these old ones available

the problem is that these states under the amp only developed over considerable periods of time it required a very long social process in order that the voluntary administrative bodies that arose out out of primitive society could coalesce into a bureaucratic state apparatus and even then not without struggle and repeated complete social overturns as the history of china demonstrates with one dynasty replacing another nor was the position of these states secured purely on the basis of force in china as barrington moore jnr shows the state bureaucracy was recruited on the basis of stringent exams its true the bureaucracy through its privileged position could educate its children in order to pass those exams but it was also forced to ally itself with the powerful landlord class which in reality provided most of the recruits for the state and where powerful landlord families did not have clever enough children themselves they used to adopt clever children of peasants and train them for a position in india the position was even clearer this caste system whereby it was control over the means of production and over the state which was more important than ownership could only exist on the basis of extensive laws and taboos that restricted entry by birth

africa today is the worst place for a child to be born or grow up due to poverty and lack of opportunities there are many cities towns and villages where children go to school without food or eat once a day something unimaginable in western societies due to poverty most children under five are malnourished and underweight the children are not properly clothed or sheltered they do not receive much attention from their parents due to the pervasive and extreme nature of poverty children prematurely become adults at the age of ten sometimes even less they take on the responsibility of adults scavenge for food and work to bring home income to support the family as a result absenteeism in schools are high as many students swap their education for income generating activities such as fishing farming and hawking an act that continue to fuel and perpetuate the poverty cycle they suffer many abuses silently in the hands of those who employ them and many are maladjusted in the villages and in the rural areas kids walk bare footed to school and even to church or mosque in most rural areas students have to study with lantern because there is no electricity in the rural areas children have no class rooms and have to study under trees today in sierra leone as in many places in africa a child is more likely to die at birth or die before reaching the age of five

a recent paper entitled the market for financial advice an audit study by sendhil mullainathan of harvard markus nöth of the university of hamburg and antoinette schoar of mit is as distressing as it is expected the authors sent trained auditors to meet with financial advisers and presented them with different types of portfolios these portfolios reflected either biases that were in line with the financial interests of the advisors eg returnschasing portfolio or which ran counter to advisor interests eg a portfolio with company stock or very lowfee index funds they concluded that advisors fail to debias their clients and often reinforce biases that are in the interests of the advisor advisors encourage returnschasing behavior and push for actively managed funds that have higher fees even if the client starts with a welldiversified lowfee portfolio

bottom line i enjoyed this it asks some serious philosophical questions in the midst of everything and there are no easy answers this is not just a crime novel or a psychological thriller i like that ian rankin chose to be a crime novelist because he realised that a detective was the perfect tool to prise open the lid of society hes a serious novelist masquerading as a crime fiction writer and i believe the same is true of ruth dugdall the sacrificial man is also topical sir terry pratchett for one having raised the publics awareness of the subject the copy i was sent has four pages at the front praising ruths writing but ill echo what frances day an amazon reviewer had to say both ruths novels are a refreshing change from the usual crime mystery populated with real character you can believe in i would have no problems reading her next book but i would like to see something a little different next time when william mcilvanney another serious novelist wrote his third and final laidlaw novel rather than writing in the third person as he had done in his first two novels he wrote strange loyalties in the first person presenting a very different book i would like to see cate austin come out of the shadows

a painting done outside rather than in a studio is said to be painted en plein air the term comes from the french en plein air meaning in the open air it seems like most aspects of getting away on a sunday to paint would be relaxing it seems like a great experience to paint with others and also dedicate time to getting back into the love of painting it will also serve as a creative change of scenery as it places me outside of my beadmaking studio during a plein air experience i will also be dealing with space and supply limitations weather conditions gnats and insects travel issues to find the different paint locations and light changes all are creative obstacles that make the whole experience memorable and unique i look forward to each experience as a creative and learning situation

the gods took a while to consider this for it was not the settlement they were expecting and they were uneasy that one of them might have to marry this ice queen odin said you may choose your husband from among us but you must do so only by looking at his feet at this skadi smiled for she knew that being so beautiful baldur would have the most exquisite feet and her task would be easy the gods removed their shoes and stood in a circle around her carefully she searched among them for the feet she thought would be baldurs finally she came to the one she was sure must be him they were strong and slim brown and wellshaped skadi had never seen such beautiful feet in all her life i chose you she said looking up into the face of her husband but instead of baldur she met eyes that were grey blue and green their colours shifting and changing like the ocean he had brown and weathered skin from working a lifetime as a sailor and an expression that was gentle strong and kind njord lord of the seas smiled at her skadi was angry you have tricked me she snarled yet there was something in njords face that stopped her and she found herself fascinated by him drawn to the smell of salt on his skin and the bitter tang of his hair the way that he looked at her and she felt her heart soften odin nodded in satisfied agreement a good match he said skadi then smiled a bitter smile you have forgotten the second part of our bargain one of you must make me laugh for since you took my father from me i have only felt sadness odin turned to loki trickster can you make this woman laugh loki stepped forward a little sheepishly wondering how much skadi knew about his own hand in her fathers death loki said i have the perfect remedy for only this morning at market i bought this goat after all what is funnier than a goat loki capered in front of skadi and she looked at him suspiciously loki continued only i had my arms so full of other wares i had to lead her home like this loki took one end of the rope and tied it to the beard of the nanny goat and the other end he tied around his testicles the goat bleated in rage at being tethered and set off around the courtyard yanking loki along behind her who squealed and bleated louder than the goat the other gods were helpless with laughter finally the two came to a halt in front of skadi loki fell into her lap and looked up at her with a ridiculous expression on his face in spite of herself skadi laughed a laugh that rose from her belly and melted her heart and for the first time in months she was glad and so forgave the aesir then odin feeling that he still wished to make further amends for the death of the great giant thiasi took from a pouch two milky white globes skadi gasped recognising them instantly as her fathers eyes odin said i know how much you miss him and he flung the eyes far up into the heavens where they settled as two bright stars now you will always be able to see him and he will always watch over you skadi was satisfied her father avenged and remembered she turned to njord i will gladly take you as my husband but i cannot live in noatun your sea home we must live together at my home in the mountains for i fear that my heart would break all over again for the missing of it njord knew this would be hard for he had spent his life at sea but he loved skadi and wished to make her happy so he agreed

 by stephen king my first and probably only stephen king but i loved it loved time travel novels are kind of my kryptonite and this one was ahmazing jake epping is a high school teacher in presentday maine divorced from a manipulative alcoholic when he reads an essay by one of his night ged students about the night the students father committed a brutal multiple murder that shocking tale is still reverberating in jakes head when his sortof friend al templeton drops a major bombshell the storeroom in als diner is a portal to a timetraveler whos willing to risk well everything could pop through take up residence in the past and prevent lee harvey oswald from shooting jfk in al cant carry the mission through himself hes returned from an attempt just to die of lung cancer jake is intrigued and he thinks he might be able to stop his students father from committing his horrific crime if he travels back so he goes what jake doesnt bargain for is falling in love which he does with a lovely albeit klutzy librarian named sadie dunhill will jake be able to carry out his business in the past and save jfk or will his love for sadie distract him from the dangerous work he has to do and if he succeeds what consequences might flow from his act is a tome that kept me feverishly turning pages including over in one day its just that exciting its also violent and contains some pretty offensive language so potential readers beware this wasnt stephen kings usual fare which might be why i loved it so much because horror doesnt hold much appeal for me although time travel suspense love stories do i loved jack finneys time and again and king thanks finney in his acknowledgements makes sense after reading this heartwrenching pageturner theres nothing for me to do but add my voice to the chorus saying all hail the king

i have been so inspired by so many of the beautiful banners out there on scs on pinterest everywhere i decided to jump in and try one for myself i cut out three triangles from burlap i didnt measure just sort of winged it i also cut out three triangles from card stock again no measuring i glued each burlap piece down to the card stock using mod podge once that dried it didnt take very long i painted each piece with white acrylic paint while those pieces were drying i stamped the new it is well with my soul stamp onto some card stock pieces and tore them out distressed them and sponged on them then i stamped the light house from the light of the world set for some reason it seemed important to use this set it was the very first stamp set that our daily bread designs released and it just felt right i colored the image lightly with copics and then lightly painted over the whole thing with the white paint again i glued these to the banner pieces with beacon in glue then i attached the lace seam binding and buttons i used hemp to attach the banners to for displaying

so what do our kids really need from these years well they need to learn a lot of stuff humans are wired to learn to be curious and to try to fit into the tribe kids left to their own devices in a rich not necessarily enriched environment will learn just try to stop them they constantly watch listen absorb ask questions think space out poke things and try new stuff do we need to focus on teaching them particular things at particular times if we grownups need to know something we go learn it why should we set the schedule for them do we have some special knowledge that they will need a particular skill or bit of knowledge to fulfill some goal later in life no we dont more importantly no manner of assessment will guarantee that they will learn really learn anything we decide to teach them we learn best when what were learning is interesting entertaining fulfilling for us we learn best when curiosity drives exploration and study not when a syllabus and a class bell announce the next subject as long as joe and i have the luxury of being responsible for our kids education the best things we can do to prepare them for adulthood are to a introduce them to our world by sharing our interests and our daily lives with them and b listen to them and help them find answers resources and new ideas in whatever direction their curiosity pulls them

one of the most visible major industries in france are the car makers luckily for french car makers the french are very patriotic about driving french cars i doubt the main french car makers would have survived had the french people not supported them this is because until quite recently peugeot and renault cars were a bit crap and citroens were just wierd the french are the masters of their own universe though and while they are key players in the eu they actually just stick two fingers up to all the myriad legislation pumped out by the jobsworths in brussels the rest of the eu nations hop to the eu beat and the french who are the primary architects of the rules ignore the rules how very french

those that write purely as an act of catharsis often produce terrible work ive read far too many plays by people who should really have been having that conversation with the person involved or a therapist rather than pretending that it was ever a good subject for drama but this book which so clearly serves a double purpose to conquer the shame instilled by a father who belittled his son from a young age and to conquer an even grander foe the fear of death somehow manages to claim its position as a work of art whilst also being an act of confession a personal memoir and also a piece of fiction a book hard to categorise and even to enjoy at times but one which despite its meandering makes other books seem spineless afterwards one that succeeded in helping knausgaard to deal with his fathers death one can only wonder whether it worked the same magic on his legacy

how can you claim to live for the purpose of god in your life yet all you care about is yourself and what you can get from life yes life is meant to be enjoyed and lived but with god being the centre focus of all we do and aim for in life surely god has to take preference in your life when we focus and ask god to show us what he wants for us he is glorified i know many will say and feel that it is unfair and even boring to live for god there was a time for me when it was frustrating to consider god first whenever i wanted to do something for myself but it becomes easier especially the more you understand and believe that god always prospers us and that every decision that comes from him is good and will never fail one thing is certain if we are born again believers we should not be selfish and want to live for ourselves we see in the cross how jesus died for the whole world jesus sacrificed his life so that we could gain life and true life in him think about your spouse or your kids you have to consider where you are going with your future and every decision has to include them and not just what you want the best way to know that you are not just considering yourself and being selfish is to go to god for your advise seek his word spend time reading the bible and let him confirm the decisions you need to make for many of us this can become tiresome but dont you want to prosper dont you want to make the right decisions you can bet your life on the advise jesus gives you

from humor to sarcasm children tend to delight in the humorous poetry that many childrens poets write once your students have tried their hand at writing humorous poetry push them to the next level writing sarcasm since sarcasm is often a difficult concept for children to grasp scaffold their attempts by clearly defining what sarcasm is comparing and contrasting sarcastic poems with humorous ones and then encouraging students to locate examples of sarcastic poetry in the humorous poetry they already know shel silverstein and jack prelutsky both noted for their adroitness with humor have sarcastic poems in many of their collections it often helps to begin with a topic or character they know well such as a popular fairy tale character and then showing how if that character makes a sarcastic remark se is really saying it to be funny

my main problem with voyager aside from everything is the cast i found very few cast members who grew on me or inspired my sympathy while i enjoyed captain janeway i did not enjoy many of the other characters chakotey bellaina ensign kim and even never seemed to grow on me though the more i watch it the more i feel for neelix and kess were the low points in the show while attempting to add alien eccentricities all these characters did was cause unneeded problems and further my dislike for other characters as they began to friend and trust these two paris and the doctor were the only two characters whom i can honestly say i enjoyed paris character got better and better and the doctor added muchneeded comic relief and added the ambiguous factor the ambiguous factor being a character who doesnt understand humanity for what ever reasons the doctor follows spock data and odo on this list this leaves me with tuvok the vulcan who shouldnt have been spock while campy at the time was the ultimate in terms of the vulcan race since his characterization others just fall flat tuvok was not a horrible character just predictable and underused while being overused all the same

in other words workers should recognise that real wealth is not made up of all those scraps of paper be they euros share certificates bond certificates etc with which the capitalist system has become transfixed by and which has caused the current financial crisis but is made up of the physical things produced by workers themselves be they the end commodities which are consumed or be they the things used to produce those commodities the building the machines the materials and so on and above all the labourpower of the workers themselves once that fact is grasped the solution becomes obvious it is to ensure that all of those things continue to be utilised to their maximum potential and that the fetish of the bits of paper is put to an end

all in all we really enjoyed the evening the talk about the wines which didnt assume any level of prior knowledge was interesting and it was nice to be able to try different wines along with each of the dishes on the face of it the evening is not cheap at per head but for what we had in terms of food and wine it actually represents excellent value im concerned though that the cost could be prohibitive for some people as its more than many would want to pay for a week night outing as always the food was good and the service friendly and welcoming it was clear that all the staff wanted the evening to feel special and be a success we were asked for our feedback on the food at the end of the evening and it seemed that they really valued our comments and were keen to take them on board

lesson passions dont have to be gigantic or earthshattering the feeling i get when i am writing or speaking or training or facilitating is but one of my passions and i am lucky enough to get paid for it most of the time but this passion doesnt change the world and it doesnt have to i dont have to drop the other aspects of my life to pursue it i dont have to pursue it to the exclusion of other passions i dont have to do it all day every day and no one else has to notice for the most part it is kind of lonely to speak or train to an empty room ive done it it sucks some people have passions that have indeed changed the world think nelson mandela or the dalai lama or one of thousands of others and that is absolutely wonderful but the vast majority of us have passions that we pursue in relative balance and anonymity whether its building a time machine or working with legos or making music or learning karate or playing solitaire it is not the passion itself and its impact on the world that is gigantic it is the freedom to pursue it that counts

i sat crosslegged and felt at one with the universe lol the thought exploded in my mind that everything was connected everything was one there was no separation and that if everything in the universe was connected and one then there was nothing to fear i pondered this for a while and it made sense to me i felt like i had just been given one of the secrets of the universe then i suddenly heard a rattle sound coming from directly in front of me about feet away i opened my eyes and was startled and wondered what could be making that noise i knew that rattlesnakes were common in these hills but this was no rattlesnake then i heard the noise again this time coming from the right of me still out about feet away i thought maybe someone was playing a trick on me but i realized that there was no one out here i was alone and besides how could a person move noiselessly through the chaparral without me hearing them i was getting sacred and wondered what was going on then i heard the noise except this time it was directly behind me then again in front except this time it was closer the noise grew louder and louder as it continued to circle me i suddenly became very afraid and my mind raced back to the carlos castaneda books that talked of encounters with spirit beings similar to the one i was encountering now whatever it was circled again growing closer with each pass that it made then it was right in front of me now remember that at this point i was still sitting crosslegged on the ground something came at me and gently pushed me backward and held me there if you were in the lotus position this is impossible to do as the weight of your upper body would tilt you and you would fall over backward this was not the case though this demonic spirit i call it that because that is what it was held me there for a while and then slowly let me up once it did i jumped to my feet and started slamming my open palm against my thigh this was a technique that i had read about from castaneda who used it when a spirit that he did not want to deal with would come to him this action would apparently repel the spirit once i had done this another thought came into my mind and it said that if i had opened myself up to the spirit it would have been able to take me out of my body and shown me the secrets of the universe

and my final card today is a christmas card that uses the same rich plaid paper as the first card the image and sentiment are from the set called tidings of joy this set is very similar to a retired set from years ago but i love the updated version because it includes a little more detail with the nativity animals around the blessed baby i colored it with markers and accented the star and marys gown with a touch of smooch pearlized accent ink i hate that photos just dont pick up the sparkle that this product gives an image i love to add it for just a little punch and i really like that it is so easy to apply the fine tipped brush is perfect for tiny details and it is as easy to paint on as nail polish we carry colors of smooch and i own every one as a matter of fact i have reordered more than once it is a relatively inexpensive way to add sparkle and visual interest to your projects so check it out

it isnt always easy finding fresh highquality food in this country supermarkets with their long complex supply chains usually offer unripe or subpar produce that leaves a lot to be desired but the usual alternative methods of provision have distinct limitations luckily technology provides one great answer to this dilemma opening up an important new avenue for smallscale producers to connect to customers

for all this my argument isnt against the merely entertaining i enjoy silly films as much as anyone else but some of these films fall into the no harm no foul done category whereas others though theyre still not deep enough as films advance a certain insidious agenda its like a third rate thinker heading a racist political party not being taken seriously for any rigor in his thought but moreso for the dangerous nature of his superficiality to advance problematic messages there is no requirement of deep thought behind them in politics for example it is usually the most basic message that is most effective but even this elementary message nonetheless rests on all kinds of theoretical assumptions and so in the language of cinematic example once more i object to the quintessential srk film not the average akshay kumar starrer unwatchable as i might find it

the particular customs and manners that may happen to be received in that state it is difficult to determine on the standard by which the manners of a nation may be tried whether catholic or particular it is more difficult for a native to bring to that standard the manners of his own nation familiarized to him by habit there must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us the whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions the most unremitting despotism on the one part and degrading submissions on the other our children see this and learn to imitate it for man is an imitative animal this quality is the germ of all education in him from his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees others do if a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy or his self love for restraining the intemperance of passion towards his slave it should always be a sufficient one that his child is present but generally it is not sufficient the parent storms the child looks on catches the lineaments of wrath puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves gives a loose to the worst of passions and thus nursed educated and daily exercised in tyranny cannot but be stamped by it with odious pecularities the man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances and with what execration should the statesman be loaded who permitting one half the citizens thus to trarnple on the rights of the other transforms those into despots and these into enemies destroys the morals of the one part and the amor patriae of the other for if a slave can have a country in this world it must be any other in preference to that in which he is born to live and labour for another in which he must lock up the faculties of his nature contribute as far as depends on his individual endeavours to the evanishment of the human race or entail his own miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him with the morals of the people their industry also is destroyed for in a warm climate no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him this is so true that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour and can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god that they are not to be violated but with his wrath indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep for ever that considering numbers nature and natural means only a revolution of the wheel of fortune an exchange of situation is among possible events that it may become probable by supernatural interference the almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest but it is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject through the various considerations of policy of morals of history natural and civil we must be contented to hope they will force their way into every ones mind i think a change already perceptible since the origin of the present revolution the spirit of the master is abating that of the slave rising from the dust his condition mollifying the way i hope preparing under the auspices of heaven for a total emancipation and that this is disposed in the order of events to be with the consent of the masters rather than by their extirpation

wednesday was lourve day so cam and i got up extra early to catch the metro to be there before the crowds when the museum opened i love love love art history and have been looking forward to coming to the louvre forever so i was really excited luckily cam is really on top of things and ordered us paris museum passes before we left the states these passes allow you get into almost all the museums in paris and they allow you to skip the ticket line which we had heard was key for the lourve we got there am and took some pictures in the courtyard and watch the ticket lines build in anticipation for the museums am opening we went to the entrance for people with museum passes and were one of the first people in line however more and more people who also had museum passes began lining up behind us the problem was that everyone who had these museum passes thought that they didnt have to wait in line but lots of people had the pass and everyone has to go thru security so even museum passholders have to wait however a lot of people werent understanding that and were trying to cut in line and one thing that bothers me more than anything else is when people cut in line i was basically having a panic attack because it was so chaotic and i was getting mad that people were just cutting in line whereas my calm husband kept going up to the line cutters and politely telling them that we all had museum passes and there was a line it was basically just a zoo until we finally got in the museum once we got inside we headed straight for the mona lisa and didnt have to wait in line to see her at all which was really neat because wee had heard that sometimes there are huge lines to see it its just a small painting but it was really cool to see such an iconic image in person

great ideas for keeping kids active this summer
andrew is a child of a very broken home with little hope on the horizon his moms sick and dying his dads out of work and abusive he is a troubled teenager to the extreme and when he gets his powers he does not magically turn over a new leaf this movie is a really good portrayal of a main character that is not anyone we want to identify with or even really follow but then the film does it anyway and it turns out compelling and even arresting at times in its insanity its a great character study of kids like andrew who exist in plentitude in the real world kids who have nothing and dont seem to be on the planet for anything else other than to be punching bags for the karmic forces its tragic and the movie portrays andrews darkest moments in that light almost as much as they are deplorable and disgusting mostly theyre all three

your question takes me back to my days in the usmc stationed in okinawa japan even off duty in civilian attire we had to abide by the local commands dress code the rules included no exercise clothing unless you were actually working out no tank tops for men no spaghetti straps for women belts always worn if your clothing had belt loops no visible underwear no exposed midriff no holey tattered or dirty clothing basically we were required to look neat and sharp at all times while jeans could be worn officers like myself were discouraged from wearing them particularly at command events i had two pair of khakis that i would have to starch and iron with creases for any nonuniformed official functions how i grew to hate khaki pants

i had an amazing haircut experience this past weekend brighteyed boy and i both needed a haircut but since we hadnt planned ahead we landed at the local hair cuttery you definitely take your chances at least at this location but on the austerity plan i didnt want to pay for my regular stylist anyway i get the requisite shampoo and conditioner nothing special there but once she starts combing my hair and separating my scalp into manageable quadrants theres something about her touch that just started to hypnotize me i closed my eyes and i think my mouth was hanging open she was slow and methodical but the little tugs as she separated a bit to snip the whisper of the scissors then moving on to the next little piece to trim it all felt so good it made me go all weak in the joints it felt so good i didnt want it to end so i uncharacteristically let her blow dry i have curly hair and i dont fuss with it much and i never blow it dry generally i dont want it blown dry when i get it cut because i need it to look good the way i style it which is wash towel dry comb out a little antifrizz product and call it done

mark who had been quiet so far now spoke up he said that he hadnt appreciated the humour either he found a joke of toms tom calls greasy cheeseburgers cheesy greaseburgers if i recall correctly simply puerile rather than as i do amusing and heartlifting evidence of toms ability to move from gloomy academicallycouched existential angst to simple lifeaffirming humour in fact mark said he hadnt liked the book at all he said he had to admit that this was largely because as an admirer of austers previous style he was disappointed by the change but also he thought it sentimental he didnt as most of us did find the book touching he didnt think the nineyearold nieces mutism credible though he also announced that he hadnt found the book worth finishing so he would have missed the explanation provided at the end he said he strongly agreed with johns suggestion that this book had been written cynically to commission as a book and had failed

it seems to me that many people are walking or should i say running around today in a state of tunnel vision living life as others expect them to live it as opposed to living it the way they would choose if they had a choice they get up in the morning grab a very quick breakfast if you could call it that and head off to work many are probably eating their breakfast in the car so that theyre not wasting any time they get to work and the routine starts either rushing from meeting to meeting or heads down in their cubicle trying to complete everything that they can in the day often not finishing until into the evening and it has to be this way because everybody else in the office is doing the same thing and thus the expectations are set finally theyre able to head home hopefully in time to sit down to dinner with the family but then their mind starts up again and theyre already thinking about what they have to do in the morning or the next day even though theyre at home theyre not really there because their mind is someplace else then the next day comes and it starts all over again
according to nytimescom for manchester city there was no added pressure at all responding to a ferguson statement where he called the match the derby of all derby games mancini didnt bend to his manipulation and said we dont have pressure we dont have anything to lose mancini was merely taking it all in stride while ferguson was stressing the importance of the game which could have easily increased the players anxiety truthfully the game was a mustwin situation for both teams because it may be the deciding factor to a title but mancini didnt want to add any unneeded pressure the pressures of their own crowd and the media hype would be enough and the players didnt need anymore from their coach this tactic seemed to pay off and even after the manchester evening news told both sets of players that they will be legends or losers man city had the upper hand for nearly the entire game maybe it was because of their home crowd and the fact that they are at home or maybe it was because mancini didnt let the outlying pressures get to him or his players but manchester city outplayed manchester united and after the most seismic local tearup in the history of english football they are in place to win their first premier league championship since

now its important to be aware of who we are in this game of loved and lovers we play very important parts in making our egocentric lifestyles function you see we the attention whores really are nothing if you the attention johns dont want to readear what we have to sayo we have no reason for being and dont believe the crack about i only do this for me but if you want to read it you can but i dont give a crap its just for me my fellow attwhores i ask you really lets not lie to ourselves somewhere in our past we lost our voice it was taken oppressed suppressed violated or simply not smart enough to articulate our overactive imaginations or express our need for the use of pretentious dialogue like an episode of dawsons creek but we have reclaimed our power and are grabbing this brave new world by its perked nips and simply not letting go and for that reason we love it the satisfaction of speaking at because lets be honest we arent speaking to anyone but ourselves our audience and knowing that they are eating up every word we say is wellarousing is it not verbal masturbation has us waking up with words in our mouths ready to spit at the world every day with the hopes that someone will want to be the receiving end of our preprepared drivel but like bad food in a sick stomach its so damn satisfying when we finally get it out we love the experience of knowing that everyone in our world can speak but weve been selfappointed with the task of being much more than a voice we are the new scribes of our generation and in years the internet will be littered with the faint echoes of our voices as we express our views on our culture and time we are writing the books of the bible on the s and s in a way that jesus himself would have ordained his followers to do about their accounts with him had they the ability i can see it now oooooh shit my boy just turned this muthafin party up with that water into wine shit world star baby
ive never fished in paris though and neither can i say that i regularly see people fishing on the seine or the canal st martin the water of this city is brown and opaque and seemingly used only as a route for pleasure boat traffic and as a reflective surface for riverside architecture for pierron though it is a growing activity in an environment which has a lot to teach us it is the last truly wild natural environment that exists in cities he explains at first view street fishers are not in a natural environment but as soon as they are next to the water their focus is only on this last territory of wild life the environmental aspect to this lifestyle choice is clearly revindicated as pierron outlines after the dark years of pollution this is clearly a reappropriation of urban waters previously there were just three species of fish in the seine but the fishing community today has now counted different species including salmon

ben has built the harvest around the backbone of his bridge road australian ale and that in itself is a fair base to work from aiming in a way for that rich strength of flavour and aroma found in many good us and new zealand craft beers the harvest delivers in bucket loads this may be due to the amount as well as the quality of this new hop as ben told me had to keep adding more hop flowers and ended up throwing pellets at it as well wasnt getting enough from the whole flowers and was worried about getting them out of the tank

people naturally listen to a story more easily than a stepbystep relating of an abstract thought even though the abstraction will carry more useful information per unit of time people will even listen to a long story if it appears to be going somewhere with the longer time frame allowed a storyteller more information can be delivered before an interruption ideas delivered in the form of abstract information will create thoughts and examples and counterthoughts and counterexamples in the listeners mind they will then want to speak them out and will readily butt into an abstract statement whereas a story that seems to be going somewhere will not have a conclusion until the end and so the listeners will tend to sit quietly and listen therefore one should communicate abstract ideas by using stories and only at the end of the story have a memorable bon mot a take home message and an action which the listener can and will participate in after the conversation

its a difficult thing to have too many cooks in the kitchen especially when all of them are iron chefs joel phelps semiforced exit made a big difference on one hand it was bad phelps was an integral part of the band since its inception and on the other it was good the pareddown sound fit the band well and thats quite evident on the foursided firewater left to two voices the band produces its most cohesive and precise set despite it being their most broad firewater clocks in with tracks at an hour long not a minute is wasted and everything sounds more measured and relaxed lyrically the themes of each song tie in with a couple concepts in mind not suffering from the somewhat schizo topics of previous lps as the lone guitarist cohen spreads his wings turning in some lengthy solos at times his scorchy leads seem twice as loud as the bass and drums but its called for each time midgetts thick bass becomes more of a centerpiece than an anchor sounding its thickest yet stripped bare to the degree of sounding awkward on the first few listens a couple songs rely mainly on light rhythms and little else the records themes of alienation and inebriation are balanced by spells of dark humor cohen is always reliable for the occasional zinger and midgetts woesoftheroad miracle mile provides many yuks at the bands expense also the occasional cathartic yelping and complex structures seem to be done away with in favor of more classic influences the stonesy lure of beauty and decreasing tangential incidents though one hates to say it in the wake of phelps firewater sounds like a band thats just lost its training wheels fuller yet less cluttered amg

the genetic characterization of native mexicans is important to understand multiethnic based features influencing the medical genetics of present mexican populations as well as to the reconstruct the peopling of the americas we describe the ychromosome genetic diversity of native mexicans from populations and individuals from native american populations after combining with publicly available data we found extensive heterogeneity among native mexican populations and ample segregation of qm and qm haplogroups within mexico the northernmost sampled populations falling outside mesoamerica pima and tarahumara showed a clear differentiation with respect to the other populations which is in agreement with previous results from mtdna lineages however our results point toward a complex genetic makeup of native mexicans whose maternal and paternal lineages reveal different narratives of their population history with sexbiased continental contributions and different admixture proportions at a continental scale we found that arctic populations and the northernmost groups from north america cluster together but we did not find a clear differentiation within mesoamerica and the rest of the continent which coupled with the fact that the majority of individuals from central and south american samples are restricted to the qm branch supports the notion that most native americans from mesoamerica southwards are descendants from a single wave of migration this observation is compatible with the idea that present day mexico might have constituted an area of transition in the diversification of paternal lineages during the colonization of the americas

the epo has a highly developed practice and case law in biotech it is a sophisticated patent office that is capable of properly assessing the patentability of biotech inventions having examiners who can understand complex biotech inventions and who take a consistent approach to patentability whilst there have been suggestions that the epo grants too many biotech patents with broad claims in our experience we find that epo examiners normally do find a fair balance between the rights of the applicant and the rights of third parties

if true this is very troubling there is case law indicating that the author retains all rights that have not been explicitly assigned to a publisher the tasini case and a preliminary finding by a judge that says that preelectronic rights contracts do not give publishers ebook rights simply because the contracts specified book rights random house inc v rosetta book llc while the issue is by no means resolved unfortunately rosetta books settled with random house and the actual dispute wasnt litigated so we dont know for sure how the case would have turned out thats surely enough case law to indicate that for outofprint works the author is likely to be the rightsholder that hathitrust and projects like it should be looking for

my experience of druidry is that we tend to be pragmatic about pain you wont catch many druids seriously ascribing it to past life misbehaviour or ineffable plans we can be collectively quite ruthless when it comes to looking for our own involvement in what happens to us we tend not to blame the gods but look at what we could have or can do differently the sphere of action is entirely human even if we do seek advice and input from elsewhere druidry does not encourage people towards spiritual masochism or to the willing acceptance of needless burdens of suffering it does encourage us towards making the best of what we have and doing what we can for ourselves and reaching out to others for help guidance and support when we need it and to offer the same

god is never the origin of temptation god has called us to a life of holiness the lord would rather see us take the path of holy subjection to his will and flee temptation jesus taught us to pray lead us not into temptation that is dont leave us to go our own dangerous way which would expose us to pressures from the enemy of our souls
i am of the considered opinion that whereas the boer nation can even still today do without the afrikaanse the afrikaanse cannot do without the boer nation and his land minerals economic activity his energy and drive etc etc decades ago when i used to debate on the subject of secession from the greater south africa and reestablishing the boer republics the politically dimwitted would ask me how transvaal never say the transvaal could go it alone without seaports of course they forget that johannesburg is officially considered a port and the sa navy has its hq in pretoria also these dimwits have never heard of aircraft and the rest of the white mans magic that would make it childs play to not have a sea port also who said anything about there being no cooperation between the boer republics and cape colony and kwa zulu natal and of course mozambique they also forget that many other flourishing nations have landlocked countries for instance the swiss who have very little in the way of minerals and other commodities but they do have white mans brains so as i used to say to them it is rather a case of whether the cape colony and kwa zulu natal would remain viable for long if transvaal and orange free state were to be reestablished as sovereign countries especially if no trade were to take place between these entities the cape province with its wine fruit and wheat culture kwa zulu natal with its sugar cane and a few bananas even with their ports both would have to expand the rotten thing called tourism so as to survive transvaal alone has much more of everything than all the others combined and you have to see the maize corn to americans farms of orange free state it makes oklahoma corn look like a childs sand pit

the games system has however two very specific instances where player choice is essential the most obvious one is what each figure does with its allocated actions this happens in most every game and we will deal with it a bit later the other one is more important and a big part of the game a player can freely choose how many activation dice to roll from to the more succesful rolls the more actions the figure has but two or more failures mean the turn passes to the opponent you can see this game is pretty hectic and when playing solitaire it has a life of its own

a note on the term zebra in the context of the nois genocidal campaign zebra has been considered by many blacks to be controversial and even racist they are offended by the terms blackonwhite imagery the term was employed by the sfpd because the department reserved radio frequency z for all broadcasts related to the specific killing spree at hand killings were considered a part of the spree that were committed executionstyle by a black against a white using a gun only after anthony harris came in did police discover that the machete killing of quita hague was a zebra killing police also did not associate the hague killing with the zebra killings that followed it because jesse lee cooks sexually molested quita hague and robbed the couple for claritys sake all military and police organizations use a term for each letter in the alphabet thus when one refers to a company one instead says alpha company for b company bravo company and so on one proceeds similarly when reading off a license plate number to a police dispatcher for z one says zebra

the weeks certainly do roll past quickly last evening i was working on a project that i had put off conquering that left my mind in a completely different direction there is not enough of it left to spread in more than one place so i quickly chose two recipes and a thought flashed through my extended mind which i quickly grasped and calmly went to bed thinking that i had everything under control i awakened in the wee hours this morning with my subconscious nudging me that i still had this job to do i was tempted to just pull the covers up tightly and pretend that i had a free day that did not happen and i also could not recall what i had decided to focus on this week that was scary enough to really wake me up as i pondered deeply and discarded a few substituted ideas my original idea floated past so i scrambled only to me it was a scramble to those of you who already have your day well on its way it was more like slow motion out of bed and here i am much earlier than i ever planned before my thoughts vanish again

the emphasis should remain on the translation of works in the target language ie the direct method language should be taught with the strict grammar rules being the basis it is certainly puzzling that current textbooks are very innovative with the presentation of culture the use of authentic and interesting readings and the inclusion of the most recent technologybased materials but have lagged behind in their approaches to teaching grammar fernández by discounting the accuracy of grammar in general we cannot hope that students will acquire such skills as moodselection the acquisition of such skills as moodselection indicative vs subjunctive is typically only mastered by speakers of a similar language such as french students learning spanish collentine on the other hand not knowing the rules will only degrade comprehension in conversation with a native speaker day this is yet one more reason to drill and kill the grammar rules and to shun eastern languages as they do not have this particular aspect nonetheless grammar is what students of a foreign language need to understand before they can become successful l users fernández it is through the direct method and constant drilling of structures and vocabulary that students will eventually become comfortable enough to speak the target language in a supportive atmosphere

then theres the thing if you yourself ever had one of those recent symbolic death moments for the last few years ive lived my life according to the myth of a star is born with me the boozy hasbeen author my ward the younger ascendant star in blogging then a couple weeks ago while listening to my ipod on random shuffle and flipping through tv with the sound off i stumbled onto tcm in the midst of the long scene of james mason gearing up for his suicide in the george cukordirected version of a star is born now ive seen this version only up to the intermission but i knew because of the song on the shuffle the grey ship by ema what the long shots of mason looking out to sea saying tearful goodbyes to judy and friends really meant what was going to happen the song fit perfectly as sometimes happens the editing and beats matched so perfectly that i knew it was a cosmic message as i thought look a ghost grey ship is coming my way and it didnt even have to stop it just kept on going my intermission was over and the long voyage into the infinite was now underway like back when i stumbled onto flatliners in see here ive had other weird synchronicity moments before or since but this was another symbolic death moment a substitute for an actual death imagined in my chosen star is born mythos mason did the long swim so i wouldnt have to and either way old personal myths are inevitably shed like a snakes old skin like a snake of life and only perhaps do you die for real many many skins down the line but as tree shows your skins come fast and furious

the haunting unravels not just as a haunted house yarn but a detailed character study eleanor is a fascinating wonderfully layered character in any other film shed be the hysterical nervous wreck like barbara in night of the living dead or veronica cartwright in alien as she is our way into the story and were privy to her thoughts shes immediately signalled as the protagonist and a compelling unconventional one at that while she is obviously fraught over emotional and easily unnerved she is also strong willed eleanor has spent her adult life caring for her ill mother and has led a repressed sheltered existence longing for independence this repression extends to her sexuality and we learn that when she was young she was plagued by a poltergeist given her pubescent age when this happened the possible haunting becomes bound up in notions of traumatic sexual awakening much like it did in the exorcist and poltergeist with the onset of puberty and eventual sexual repression connected to the sinister occurrences internal monologue sheds more light on what makes her tick she is uptight and neurotic but she knows it and it fuels her need for acceptance her fondness for dr markway resembles a studentprofessor crush highlighting her adolescent naivety its interesting that when she realises he is married things take a turn for the worse in the house and her hope of a fresh start drastically dims

the financial times recently declared swedens finance minister anders borg as the most effective finance minister in europe why simple really instead of jumping on the collective spend spend spend borrowed money mantra bus mr borg sat back looked at history and realised that it wouldnt work so instead he decided to cut taxes permanently by cutting welfare spending he also gasp cut property taxes for the rich he justified this by saying that only entrepreneurs could create wealth and if thats what he had to do to lure them back to sweden then thats what hed do and it worked can you imagine what the us democrats would say to that reasoning the result sweden had the fastest growth in europe last year crazy hey who wouldve thought that by giving money back to people youd create wealth well conservatives know it thats why economies run by conservatives usually prosper until the liberals get back into power by promising unicorns and fairies and more welfare reform and get them back into debt and more under government control today most of europes economies are basket cases where their governments have overborrowed and overspent with very little of the stimulus going to the actual economy but theyre now stuck with the bill to pay off the banks that lent the money are doing just fine though this is money laundering and fraud on a huge scale where tax payers get to pay back the money borrowed plus all the interest on the loan and certain banks proper hugely im no fan of sweden for how they treated white south africans during the s but mr borg i salute you you had the courage to go against the mainstream idiot thinking of spending for no benefit to the country instead sweden today has a vibrant economy and the rest of europe is drowning in debt all under their reelected conservative coalition government the usa and the australian governments also used the spend spend spend mantra to waste tax payers money on paying off their political supporters and used the global financial crisis to hide this fraud when obama came into power america had entered a slight recession today after blowing nearly trillion on his stimulus experiment the country is in deep recession with gas prices rocketing and employment figures stagnating australia is no better with a debt of over billion half of what greece owes isnt it wonderful having lefties running once productive countries into the ground yeah unfortunately thats exactly what the people voted for because apparently repeating that lunacy of voting labortype governments will bring in different results any day now read the article to understand just how forwardthinking this man is

onion soup is an amazing kind of recipe i searched for different kinds of onion soup but the french version is the most popular if not the only one out there it has everything one could ever ask for in the attempt to using up whatever is lying around onions leftover beef stock stale bread and cheese you havent used up yet it is a sticktoyourribs kind of soup rich and dense with essentially all of the main food groups provided so to no offense of the french since i have the privilege of knowing quite a few amazing people from the country i made my own kind of onion soup something lighter and with a homemade chicken stock base whats so marvelous about this recipe is that you essentially have two meals the onion soup and the chicken and veggies for another day you can also place the meats and veggies from the stock at the bottom for additional nutrition i made skillet cornbread modifying the ingredients but otherwise made the same way as i usually do

we all love watching our children perform and as i told you in my previous post the pride we feel is immense i used to record amys school plays when she was little and would put it on video to sell to proud parents and family thus raising a little money for the school once the videos were available to buy at just a few pounds each a letter went out to parents inviting them to purchase a copy unfortunately the last time i recorded it the school received a note from a parent saying they did not give permission for their child to be included in a recording of the school play and so the following year the school sent out a letter a week before the play to all parents asking for them to sign a slip and give their permission for their child to be recorded out of children one of their parents sent the slip back saying no i do not give my permission that was the end of that from then on no one was allowed to record any performances or take photographs during a school play just in case little joe bloggs was included in the shot i wasnt the only one who found it sad i have to say

in the end there may be a universal truth but in the mean time were speaking for whatever divine power is defining those truths and writing these commandments and codes of social morality st paul may tolerate the atrocities of his time or he may have excused them or even found them morally justified the society he lived in found justification despite or if you take the whole book they found their morality in because of that code of morality the ancient jews found their justification in divine truth as did the babylonians sumerians romans and every believer of nonsecular morality to suggest secular moralists need to find a higher source of universal truth in morality is placing a challenge that nonsecularists are unwilling to or incapable of taking on because in the end nonsecular morality is secular morality with a halo slapped on it

the films visual emphasis is confirmed right from its extraordinary opening sequence in which it takes nearly ten minutes for anyone to say a word instead rollin simply delivers one mysterious outrageous set piece after another cult scientists in red hoods strip a girl wearing a similar hood and inject her with colorcoded chemicals that drip into beakers around the lab the bright chemicals look like dyes prepared for easter eggs more than scientific solutions but no matter the pacing is slow almost narcotized and rollin cuts between steady silent closeups the redhooded men their eyes peering out through thin ragged slits in their cloth hoods the beakers and scientific equipment around the room the girls eyes peering out from behind her own hood in the next scene a girl caroline cartier in a gauzy orange dress naked beneath the thin translucent material runs through the darkness pursued by men in animal masks this sequence is evocative and beautiful and creepy the girl and her pursuers casting elongated shadows on the blank walls of the buildings rollin making excellent use of wide expanses of negative space with the girl trapped between these monstrous shadowcreatures the deliberate pacing only adds to the creepiness of it all with rollin frequently cutting in inscrutable closeups of the men in their gaudy sinister masks

i like thomas hardy and george eliot for their authenticity they were actually seeing an england that has vanished i like stephen king for his quirky characters and ian rankin for his gripping story lines i have also recently discovered tess gerritsen a brilliant american crime novelist i also like to read about the english countryside in bygone days particularly books by the early naturalists such as gilbert white and richard jefferies
augustine writes he has accomplished what he taught us he has shown us what he commanded us to do he laid down his own life for his sheep that within our mystery he might change his body and blood into food and nourish the sheep he had redeemed with the food of his own flesh he has shown us the way we must follow despite fear of death he has laid down the pattern to which we must conform ourselves the first duty laid on us is to use our worldly goods in mercy for the needs of his sheep and then if necessary give even our lives for them he that will not give of his substance for his sheep how shall he lay down his life for them tr in john th century do you look to jesus the good shepherd to receive the strength and courage you need to live and serve as his disciple
but what of the results does the international success tell us that the locals have dropped their game or that we are resting on our laurels hardly when you consider the volume of beer presented and the high standard of craft brewing around the world right now australias modest population should be very proud of our place on the world stage couple this with the fact that more and more international brewing heavyweights are sending beers to our awards and you can see that the overall quality is extremely impressive again for the nerds ill list some facts and figures and results for now its just about the occasion

i realise how little we know or care about those who are behind us in our careers or those who are in jobs less glamorous than us take an example for the show abovementioned we think about how to increase sales by giving great customer service but we forget the difficulties of our staff in living up to some unrealistic standards that are to be offered at their expense we think about recycling and saving the environment but we forget the toil and harsh environments we put our staff in just to achieve what claim we can offer of course someone out there is going to talk about society and how sacrifices are made as a normal cycle of life survival of the fittest the human foodchain and every other theory we can conjure or pull together i dont disagree im just saying its a sad fact that we forget too soon how we were once at the bottom of the foodchain suffering all the unimaginables and we subject others unwittingly or not to it after we depart from the sorry state now with reference to the very same show above i noticed how a little kind gesture could make a big difference you hear in the show about employees who love their jobs but face constraints due to long hours undesirable conditions or simply personal family issues sometimes we really arent asking for too much an extra day of leave some flexibility in work hours a holiday maybe when the organisation stops to listen to your needs and tries to help you in fulfilling them you can imagine how happy the employee might be the upsides are decent greater loyalty to the company higher productivity etc it really pays to be nice sometimes

just last night i stumbled upon one of these moments of magic it was after a long but wonderful weekend of touring across southern tuscany with my mother and her good friend patsy we all had a great time but after towns and several hundred kilometers of driving i can speak for everyone in saying we were beat i myself in particular was not too excited about the prospect of having to walk back across the city from their hotel to my apartment with all my luggage while simultaneously trying to balance several bottles of wine nobile and brunello its a tough life after only a few minutes i was already sweating rather uncomfortably and overall feeling pretty pathetic about my condition

we all realise that trade has dropped off since the uwic building opposite built their own student union but everyone agrees this is a pub worth saving okay the effort could have been made by cardiff council and cadw over years ago but the council is more interested in car parks for the shopping centre than preserving the heritage of the city cadw the welsh equivalent of english heritage have consistently ignored the pleas from people wishing to save this piece of heritage from the bulldozer even saying that the golden cross nearby has been given grade ii listed status as its a better quality building completely missing the point that this tiledfrontage building is historic in hardly changing in all those years the inside was refurbished in the s and this is the layout that remains today although the unique outside gents toilets with their brown porcelain urinals are no doubt older and possibly original to the s building apparently a collector in the states is interested in buying this bit of cardiff history but i would prefer it to stay where it is

although the footage does not capture the true beauty of the reefs it gives a glimpse of their majesty and the reefs around cozumel are truly magnificent towering coral formations caves pillars overhangs complete with an amazing diversity of life including countless species of coral sponges zoanthids crustaceans fishes turtles sharks long spindly legged arrow crabs huge file fish tiny anemone shrimp and throngs of juvenile wrasse kept us company as we drifted the reefs and wove through the complex system of swim throughs i even saw something that i had never before seen a splendid toadfish these funky looking creatures are thought to be endemic to cozumel which explains why i was so excited about the first one i found i made chucho come look at it smiling wide and shrugging my shoulders as to say i have no idea he pointed to his temple and then motioned as though turning pages in a book remember well look it up i had found something totally novel and after swimming a few feet i saw it again and again those bearded toadfish made an appearance on nearly every dive after that point the real treat was seeing the whole fish as they usually hide their backsides in crevices chucho wrastled one out of its hole for a photo shoot and i was delighted to see that the rest of the toadfish was as spiffy as promised

the high point of this book is its world theres nothing quite like it and i found it more and more interesting as the story progressed on although the whole story is set in a huge megastructure there is a lot of diversity in various levels that we see throughout the tale each level seems to contain its own genetically deformed humanoids and creatures of all kinds the completely bleak art style gives a great representation of how massive and broken down this whole thing is apparently nihei finished the school for architects so he knows how buildings work and his knowledge really shines here the only thing that bothered me sometimes here is that sometimes the shading is so dark that you cant really tell whats going on but that could be due to bad scanning some volumes arent really scanned top notch

ive known my share of both kinds both shake you to the core and make you wonder if life will ever be ok again and sometime it isnt sometimes that cold and broken hallelujah comes out of the realization that something irrevocable just changed and that you have no choice but to find a new normal and it takes you out behind the knees and leaves you gasping for air on the floor and that broken heart that humbled spirit that has nothing left to offer but a hoarsely whispered hallelujah in the middle of the mess and blood and tears and the snotty nose is like a magnet for god he runs to be near even if we caused our own problems he is there instantly in that moment we are so incredibly beautiful to himand he rescues us with no regard for whether or not we deserve it were his kids he loves us so passionately its nigh scandalous

the same cannot be said of riteish deshmukh whose image is firmly planted in the minds of the audiences as that of an actor who is very much at home in playing a metoo role in multistar cast inane comedies of the likes of the golmaal or houseful he appears to be in obvious discomfort when the scene requires the camera to focus primarily on him what works for him in tnlhg is that here is that the script demands that he play second fiddle to genelia and he seems to be very happy doing that

all three novellas feel gritty to me not edgy i suppose but i tend to lean toward a more realistic approach in my writing for me that usually means a darker feel i think where this comes from is my childhood when i grew up reading those grimms and anderson fairy tales many of them are not happy and light many of them id say are disturbing you reach the end and sometimes youll think what the then youll think and think some more it was always in those moments of really thinking about the fairy tales that i found the magic inside them that is what ive aimed for in my novellas in bonded they are exciting and entertaining in my opinion but the most important layer to them is one that i hope will stick with readers long after they read them i hope that most important layer captures what i always felt growing up i believe that kind of a layer is what makes us keep coming back to fairy tales over and over

several months ago i was asked to help a friend by creating an illustration based on a dream someone had of terrible future events this dream was detailed in their book which i was given a copy of and the illustration purpose as i was told was to draw attention to the writer and his work so that he may be able to book more speaking engagements i explained to my friend who had to repeatedly inform me they knew nothing about art or how to draw a straight line that i am not a professional illustrator but an artist and art educator and that my style is very expressionistic and they may not like it if they wanted something highly realistic well after many detailed dialogues i finally came up with some ideas and presented them i was told that i needed to reread the dream and be more realistic with the dream illustration so i did and as you can see this is my imagellustration i was asked to add a few more details to the image

i raise this issue not because i think the doctrine of inerrancy is unimportant or even false but simply because i know the reality of christs resurrection is more important than an inerrant bible furthermore i dont want anyones faith in christ to be hindered or destroyed due to perceived errors in the biblical text our faith should be grounded in nothing less than the resurrected person of jesus christ it is in christ that the truth of christianity stands or falls and thus the focus of our christian faith should be the resurrected jesus not the inerrancy of scripture

motoroughness just as persistent as he is off the field hamilton also shows a good amount of persistency while giving chase on the backside in pursuit with that said i do think hamilton could be more physical at times and i am not sure if he gives his best effort from snap to snap hamiltons motor is good but i personally like to see smaller school players leave it all out on the field and having an unquestionedreat motor is something that either flashes or doesnt and in this case i didnt see it from hamilton consistently enough to catch my attention hamilton has the tools to be good but he needs to flash that mean nasty violent temperament that makes prospects stand out from the competition especially if it is at a lower level i also think this mean streak and relentless attitude would do wonders in terms of his ability to disengage and fight his way off blocks as he lacks that violent punch to jolt his defender

janet gaynors character in particular is a much softer portrayal of a rising starlet than constance bennetts brassy waitressonthe make in cukors movie as starryeyed esther blodgett gaynor is playing a character very similar to the sweet heroine of her previous film directed by wellman small town girl esther is someone who longs to escape from the frustrations of smalltown existence but who still keeps her caring values intact and is happy to sacrifice herself when she falls in love i havent seen enough of gaynors roles to generalise with confidence but suspect that this sweetness is an intrinsic part of her screen personality in both films people are always saying what a nice girl she is even when she occasionally does things that might not fit that description

the concept of form has always interested me it is in many ways a fleeting concept and yet given a lot of weight by those who comment on our nations favourite sports its both a catch all term used to define whether someone is generally doing things right or doing things wrong but also a relative term balancing a performance in one moment of time with a performance once made or a potential or optimum performance thus if i play football to my normal standard i am on form whilst if theo walcott plays like me he is off form

js perhaps the speeding analogy needs an extra dimension a speeder being convicted on the evidence of other speeders and all but one speeder getting away with it im not entirely convinced the second jury got it right but if they did i think a perjurer was convicted on the evidence of other perjurers or worse alleged criminals who bribed witnesses withheld evidence hacked phones and perverted the course of justice i dont just mean those from the news of the world or those who had their evidence discredited or the ones charged with perjury but never taken to court im including the witnesses from the ssp united left faction who appeared to change their story from one trial to the next and decided to deliver handwritten notes of ssp minutes to police after the first trial had concluded alan mccombes had been to jail for contempt of court for refusing to hand over the minutes however the handwritten notes had been in barbara scotts handbag the whole time thats all just my opinion of course

there are to be blunt huge leaps made in mcknights historical analysis here and it is intriguing the way in which he highlights the creeds positively where wright had identified their current usage as part of the problem more on that another day but it is important to focus on the larger point that mcknight is making that todays western christianity largely discards the actual historical element in the gospel in favor of a dehistoricized propositional salvation message and somewhat mystical experience of course we must not discount an individuals or communitys experience of the living christ nor can we say there are no propositions present in the basic gospel message nevertheless mcknight wants us to be focusing elsewhere on an element that has been buried for some time the robust story of which the gospel is the culmination

since losing my husband to suicide just over years ago now ive learned that everyone handles death and grief differently ive learned to respect everyone exactly where they are in that moment in their journey of grief some are very open discussing their loss others absolutely silent about it i do not pry if they dont want to discuss it just offer my condolences and let them know im there to listen should they feel so inclined i have also learned that grief is part of the healing process it comes to each of us differently but needs to occur in order to move forward pain most often accompanies grief so it too must be gone through to start the journey so waving my wand if i had one would not really be beneficial

a note on the respondents who sold their first books without an agent given the reluctance of the larger houses to deal with unagented authors the fact that nearly half the respondents had no agent surprises me however many respondents appear to have been childrens picture book writers which is one of the markets in which its more feasible to go agentless even with the bigger publishers also the numbers may be skewed by when the writers sold their booksbefore the s the big houses were still relatively open to unagented writersor to whom since smaller publishers are more likely to be willing to work directly with authors

theres no way at this rate that rosie is not now proved to be the fine and exciting writer i have always known her to be yet in the how i did it section she describes the struggles she has encountered in a commercialised publishing industry such struggles are all too common now for literary writers who are however hardly free to air them before achieving this kind of success and so the difficulties lie hidden mslexia however hearing rumours from agents that the market for fiction was in freefall publishing deals were harder to come by advances were decimated and established authors were being tossed on the scrap heap and noting that its a sad fact that many agencies employ junior staff to sift submissions and that in such a situation success depends on contacts launched their competition to test how much good debut literary fiction has been left lying by the wayside their results appear to be spectacular they say they were seriously impressed by the standard of the writing on show to find out why so much good writing was lying hidden they contacted the hundred longlisted authors it wasnt that the writers werent sending their stuff out far from it but only had managed to get an agent amongst the rest mslexia encountered a tale of near misses agents recognising the merit of manuscripts even working for long periods with the authors on manuscripts but ultimately feeling unable to sell them rosie herself writes of an agent who sent her winning book out only once leaving it languishing after a single rejection before finally confessing to her that the market was so dire at the moment he had been told by the agency to concentrate on nonfiction

today i sat down in front of the stereo for a proper listen to the entire cd and found it to be a very interesting album as progressive music sometimes does this album follows no set of musical rules or norms which is what makes it different even from a lot of prog metal having two vocalists in the band one male one female allows for a lot of creativity in the songs in particular there are times throughout the album where the two vocalists are singing different melodies and lyrics at the same time and it sounds just beautiful the album is done similar to the backandforth vocals in shadow gallerys tyrannyalbum this is a very diverse album in that there are both heavy passages as well as very tranquil ones all woven into the story that is being told the keyboarding is amazing and is showcased in a few places with some obvious jazz influences

now you might think that its status as largely blah show would make me not want to watch it let alone write about it but as bad as the show might be at times the central characters of kirk spock and mccoy really do make each episode worth watching once well maybe not the squire of gothos but everything else and once you accept that the show is going to artificially hamstring its characters and inflate the conflict through silly plot contrivances it can actually be an enjoyable show thats occasionally really really good

it is also evident that employers have repackaged or are converting or rebranding existing jobs as apprenticeships so as to meet targets and qualify for money neither is it clear how many of them may be shortterm maybe for a few months at best under the coalition many apprenticeships exist in name only and are certainly not the legally binding indentures of yesteryear that guaranteed employment on completion because again employers benefiting from plenty of applicants including plenty of graduates do not require such time serving the reality is that most do not require apprentices at all

the transition of various local polytheistic traditions to the national polytheisms of ancient europe which not every culture didthe germanic and celtic areas of europe for example didnt seem to have very many translocal deities or traditions for the most part as well as elsewhere ended up making syncretism a reality in many places the thin line between there cults becoming anywhere religions occurred as a result of a lot of these processes and a great deal of intrapantheonic syncretism took place as well in a number of these places india egypt the near east including amongst the hebraic peoples greece rome japan and a variety of other places underwent this process often in the periods immediately preceding their historic periods and yet the individual and local derivations of many of their religious phenomena can still be discerned in the earliest records and in those of many centuries afterwards this is a ready example of how syncretism did not lead to a complete blurring of boundaries or a total loss of a recognition of diversity but instead served to both create connection and preserve plurality and distinction

his album all is well his fourth effort in a body of work consisting of four proper solo lps and a couple of eps and team efforts for which amidon regularly takes a massive artistic leap is perhaps the best example of this balance between respect for the original and fearless pursuit of the new a concise sampling of ten moody tracks from the displaced pages of american musical history for the most part amidon luxuriates in the domain of traditional folk instrumentation acoustic guitar fiddle banjo piano yet its both the strange places he takes those instruments as well as the unexpected additions to the palette that make all is well such a quietly enthralling work his two pivotal collaborators young american composer nico muhly and icelandic producer valgeir sigurosson both of whom have formed their own impressive bodies of work push amidon out of his comfort zone of sparse folk exhibited on his prior album but this chicken proved falsehearted using their own backgrounds in electronic and orchestral experimentation to provide nuanced and fanciful additions to amidons evocative barebones covers

next youll want to prep your meat for the white meat chicken i took one large chicken breast trimmed it im picky about chicken in that i dont like googlies one of the billion advantages of cooking at home you know every single thing thats going into your food then i sliced the breast into halfinch medallionlike pieces i rubbed each piece with some veggie oil placed it on a sheet of saran wrap covered with another sheet of saran wrap and pounded each piece to half its original thickness this is definitely not necessary but i love thin pieces of chicken best mostly because they have more surface area which means more places for sauce to stick makes them extra tender too totally fine to skip the pounding though i threaded the chicken pieces onto wooden skewers that i had soaked in water for a bit so they dont catch fire on the grill

we see again however that conservatism is not libertarianism or anarchism president bush has spelt out very clearly that he like all conservatives before him does see a role for government but a carefully specified one the speech quoted in fact exemplifies how conservatives seek a balance between the role of government on the one hand and a great respect for the individual and individual rights and freedoms on the other hand its not simple it never has been and conservatives know that striking that balance will always be a difficult problem with no cutanddried or permanent solutions which is why conservatives have always scorned the dogmatic slogans and simplistic recipes of the left to conservatives the individual is what matters and the state is merely a necessary instrument to the leftist only grand plans theories power and collectivities matter and steamrollering the individual is no problem at all as stalin pol pot kim il sung and the great legion of leftist massmurderers worldwide attest

serendipitously atheists have charged forward thanks barack into the closet denying that they even have an hypothesis to substantiate this is in response to the request that they provide analytical evidence for their position of rejecting either the existence of a nonphysical agent or rejecting the hypothesis cum deduction indicating that hypothesis to be rationally acceptable the dash for the closet is a better indicator of the rational analytical powers of atheists than the answer to a single algebra question because it is a specific response by a specific group to a specific issue which provides differentiation of the actual issue whereas algebra is not an issue in either religion or atheism much less a differentiator

the third major character hrathen could technically be considered a villain he is a priestarriormonk who has been sent to convert arelon to the fjordell religion if arelon isnt converted within three months his superiors will destroy it however conversion to the fjordell religion would mean a loss of arelons autonomy as the religion is based on hierarchy and obedience i thought that it was a very interesting choice to use a villain as a major protagonist it definitely made the book more interesting especially as we came to understand hrathens motives and his own misgivings

this may seem obvious new mums must strengthen the pelvic floor muscles around of postnatal women suffer with some form of stress incontinence after birth and its vital to focus on them not just after birth but for life really you need to do pelvic floor exercises daily perhaps more often if you have very little sensation there it can take time for the muscles to react to conscious exercise too just keep sending the signal from your brain to the pelvic floor even if you cant feel it eventually it will switch on you need to focus on both the fasttwitch muscle fibres eg squeeze and release and the slowtwitch fibres too eg draw up hold and slowly release for effective rehabilitation if youre in doubt ask your doctor who may send you to a womens health physio for further treatment no one should be living with stress incontinence as a part of daytoday life and in the majority of cases all thats needed is some strength endurance and tone back in these muscles to get them doing their job properly again
after offering such a dire diagnosis the astonishing thing about the ancient spiritual teachings is that they offer a complete solution they suggest that the world of karma even though it surrounds us and ensnares us at every moment is not fully real beyond it lies actual reality which is reached by cultivating the subtler side of the human nervous system

to me cheating on optifast is different than cheating on other diets it is a medically supervised diet the doctors expect you to follow the program and they base their decisions and care on the assumption that they know what exactly you are eating the program is also expensive so cheating on it is cheating yourself big time in terms of money and successful weight loss
his second point concerned the god research that i mentioned he commented quite reasonably that the outcome you get would depend on the concept of god involved that the usual christian concept of god as a god of love might have been behind the finding i mentioned that thinking about god makes you more altruistic he did not address however he preferred abstract argument to research results but it is consistent with his argument that the usual christian view of god makes christians better people how embarrassing for him
the very story that he narrated in this conversation also takes us back to what the sociologists call lived religion we can go back as jimmy carter tells his story to a young boy in a local church a rural church in a deep southern state the state of georgia a southern baptist church where he did indeed develop a great love for the bible but as the twists and turns of this bible become very apparent to us mr carter also came to an understanding of the scripture in the terms of its authority and inspiration that was well at odds with where the church had historically affirmed those very truths for instance its clear that mr carter holds to what in the twentieth century would be defined as a new orthodox understanding of scripture when he speaks of the scripture containing truth and when he clearly speaks of the event of reading the scripture as being an act of revelation he is speaking the kind of language that was associated with carl barth and so many others there were many complimentary things that the new orthodox said about scripture but they did not affirm that every single word of scripture was verbally inspired something that scripture claims of itself mr carter in the midst of this conversation made some very interesting statements for instance he said that as a scientist trained as a nuclear physicists there were some things in the bible that the writers of the bible just didnt understand he said i just ignored these discrepancies as insignificant in other words he holds that the authors of scripture were not only inspired by god and the holy spirit in some sense but they were also trapped within their own systems of meaning now that is a different understanding of inspiration than what we have held that there is very clearly a divine inspiration that means that the holy spirit guards the human authors of scripture from all error that is a crucial distinction but it has to do with the question also as mr carter intimated that it was the men who were inspired more than the words who were inspired now when you start to look at that you realize that the product of divine inspiration is there very much at stake mr carter teaches the scripture with enthusiasm when he holds it in his hand he refers to it as the word of god but as he made clear in this conversation he does not believe that is a word that is in terms of plenary verbal inspiration true in every one of its words but he also believes greatly what is found in the bible he says for instance that he does affirm that miracles of the bible i was very encouraged by his very bold affirmation of believing in the virgin birth and in other super natural events recorded in the scripture but then he makes the odd statement that if those things were not true his faith in christ would still be intact that is a separation of history and theology that i believe is destructive of the gospel the gospel is predicated upon certain historical events without which there is no gospel jesus christ is not who scripture reveals him to be now that leads to other aspects of the conversation that were truly revealing having to do with how president carter deals with issues of human sexuality and sexual ethics very candidly and even courageously given his own intellectual integrity he spoke of his selectivity when it comes to those passages now we need to be very honest and say that sometimes evangelicals who hold to the inerrancy of scripture are inconsistent and often selective where we ought not to be but that means that we need to check ourselves against that kind of selectivity and make certain that we are employing a hermeneutic that is consistent with our understanding of the inerrancy and infallibility of the word of

i spent time with the lord and worked it out coming to the conclusion that even if i didnt go the ph d route and try to teach god would lead me into something great because life is more about who i am than what i do in many ways ive been stretched tremendously over the past few years in learning to process my failures with god having him walk me through those experiences rather than getting angry with him it has been a tough life lesson but one i am reluctantly learningkicking and screaming at times like a fussy little toddler so imagine my surprise when i woke up a few weeks ago to see an email in my phone marked theology decision i took a deep breath preparing myself for what seemed to be the last nail in the coffin i scanned it briefly glossing over the perfunctory cordial introduction and immediately looking for the regret to inform you or decided not at the end of the paragraph however something unexpected happened i caught ever so briefly out of the corner of my eye just for a second the word accept which caught me off guard i quickly scanned the entire email at that point and read what seemed to be an unbelievable truthi got in not only that i was offered a teaching assistantship covering full tuition and a stipend it was exactly what we needed to pull it off even if i got into a program the money thing was a big issue i had expected to get in somewhere and not have funding which would mean id have to agonizingly table the whole pursuit of ph d studies when not even that was happening i had begun to lose hope i walked in to the kitchen and read the email to my dad he was shocked as was i and we shared a celebratory high five i really couldnt believe it it seemed against all odds i had beat myself up over it and resigned myself to defeat what a difference a day can make god proved faithful in a way i hadnt quite expected i felt the weight of my entire years worth of effort come rushing in and lift me up like a strong breeze under eagles wings the lord had provided and i was there to bear witness to it i still have a hard time wrapping my head around it it seems so unbelievable i share this in the hopes that for some of us when the risk was taken and the payout didnt come there was some value in taking that step no matter the results i felt those emotions i also have known failure i believe when god is in our lives we may experience hardship but we also can experience victories god is in the midst of those things guiding us through the muck helping us process when things dont work out and patting us on the back when we experience a windfall the journey is whats important and for that i am thankful dont let a minor setback derail your journey who knows what lies ahead you just may find yourself stumbling across the path to something great

the western allies did not hunt slobodan milosevic saddam hussein and muammar algaddafi because of their bad politics but because of their good ones all the three can be seen as symbols for different versions of a dictatorship for development this includes social politics for the masses and national economic modernization yugoslavia iraq and libya for some decades used a huge amount of public money to modernise society instead of administering the state in favour of foreign investors they used the means of the nationalization of industries for social and regional development western firms had only restricted access to the markets this was one of the reasons why milosevic saddam hussein and gaddafi were considered as odious by western media and politicians

the band name is taken from the final ship that the brothers grandfather ever sailed on as a captain vigri re the making of pink boats began in flatey island the initial plan was to record the album over a one month period but soon the project began to expand from the original intentions still most of the album was recorded on an old laptop with only one microphone in accordance with the unique atmosphere surrounding the flatey island recordings the band decided to continue recording the album in unusual places such as esjustofa restaurant at the roots of esja mountain a community centre of a retirement home in reykjavík an abandoned herring storage tank in the west fjords of iceland and the tall tower of hallgrímskirkja church in the centre of reykjavík the albums name derives from a vision that haunted the band during their recording sessions when the red icelandic sunset would lie over the seas horizon and turn all the boats from white to pink

the snap peas were fired too soon so they began to wilt while the salmon and rice cooked that was just lack of forethought on my part mostly i dont fire things off too soon so that everything is fresh and just prepared at the same time it takes practice believe me then the cookie dough was ready and while i know that the dough needed to rest for twelve hours i had to make a control batch right after the dough was made to compare the hour rested dough to so i balled up some cookie dough and stuck them on a cookie sheet and pressed them down slightly with the tines of a fork i did notice that the dough was very dry and didnt stick too well or ball very well being so dry which is interesting because there is very little dry ingredients in this recipe

a thing that separates me from a lot of girls in my generation and particularly my ethnic background is that all the men in my family have been extraordinarily supportive of me my father first and foremost is my biggest fan aside from my mother he is a champion for womens rights and he fervently believes i can do pretty much anything i set my mind to and more he demanded a lot from me but ultimately it led me to achieve everything i really wanted my mother was far tougher on me for other reasons this is a mans world and you need to work twice as hard and shes right not every man i meet is my fatherno one ever could the man is a titan and his shoes need no filling

the label pornography like the word prostitution represents an attempt by lawheads to pretend that their personal hangups about sex can be reduced to a rule by which good sex can be distinguished from bad sex a bright clear taboo line which it is not permissible for anyone even in private to cross ironically the neofeminist position on the issue is actually more coherent than that of the government it simply states that any sex not initiated and totally controlled by a woman for her own pleasure and for no other reason is fundamentally wrong the more radical neofeminists such as sheila jeffreys go even further declaring that any heterosexual sex is a tool of male oppression obviously this is maddog lunacy but at least its consistent lunacy lawheads by contrast try to come up with ridiculous tests by which prostitution can be distinguished from other female sexual behavior and pornography can be distinguished from erotica or sex scenes in literature weve often discussed the former but today id like to look at the latter

whats funny is that at every single doctors appointment we only saw little girls there was never a single boy in the hospital until the day that we went for the ultrasound our first thought was since we are only seeing girls watch us have a boy so on the day of our ultrasound when we saw a boy we didnt know what to thinkit was all fun and speculation anyway after getting the news the doctor said how tall is dad apparently our little girl has long limbs a future basketball star we are certain they also said that the little one was going to be an intellectual because her brain was developing wonderfully and she was also sucking her thumb so cute that entire day the little one was just fluttering all around making herself known

it feels right to acknowledge the moment when this became fact i know that for me this has always been my obscure reality but now it is public everything i can be i can now become every dream can be sought every fear faced i can shout it now i am transsexual i didnt shout just typed fairly quietly but with a smile on my face i am so proud that somehow the real me that tenuous little being inside my hinterland survived long enough to be given life i do not mean to be dramatic but for me this moment is monumental telling people i know will be hostile towards whom and what i am is a huge step and i just feel relieved like a flood and i hate to use the word flood when so many are causing catastrophes around the world but the flood that is rushing out of me is made up of all the fears built up over years fears based on keeping me hidden hidden behind a male front i had to acquire like a costume a veneer but now i can sit here and for the first time feel proud that whatever else i have told them what and who i am i own me now thats a funny concept to own oneself at least it seems funny to me the notion that now finally i am in control of my own destiny of being me of being authentic i will now type a word and i will mean it no bullshit i truly mean what i say i think i am happy i know i am happier than yesterday i know i was right to not muddy my core with prescribed drugs i am brave braver than i ever thought i could be as brave as cleopatra when she entered rome yes i am finally a pioneer crossing my own mountain range discovering the plains within seeing the ocean for the first time i must drive to brighton and stand on the pebbles sway open my eyes and be thankful for this opportunity to all the women who have and are now supporting this journey i thank you this is my epic moment

over the years france had become a favourite destination and in whilst on holiday my family and i fell in love with a dilapidated property just on the outskirts of the small village of saint rémy de provence called mas de bérard i have always believed in love at first sight when it comes to romance but in my case it was love at first sight with an old farmhouse in that instant my life as i knew it changed and that one heart stopping moment set in motion a chain of events that altered everything on impulse we bought the property we went back to australia and promptly disentangled our lives sold our home and moved to the other side of the world i was crazy in love and had not one minutes hesitation or doubt i knew that france and in particular this old abandoned fruit farm was our future home like all things in life it wasnt as simple or as easy as all that i have three children and at that time they were young and in school my husband had business commitments and the house was unliveable we compromised and moved to london where work and schools were possible and i could renovate the farmhouse with a much easier commute i never imagined myself living in london france yes but london never to me london was buckingham palace big ben and the tower of london not a city i ever could imagine as home

consider the lovely watt panels you see for sale at your local store one would think that one of these should provide most of our power needs not so in order to figure the solar panel we need to convert from watts to amps by dividing by the voltage of the panel which is about this gives us a rate of about amps per hour because the sun moves during the day and the boat is also moving the most common thing is to mount the panels horizontally we consider that we get a total of five hours worth of sun a day so that watt panel will give us about amps per day or about half of what the fridge needs dont even talk to me about the smaller panels you see advertised

i will give you an example two neighbors two different attitudes lets say there is one neighbor that always plays really loud music on the weekends two people can have two totally different perceptions about it one guy may turn his music down and listen to the neighbors music and realize that he now has a new genre of music he likes because he is flexible ever heard the saying if you cant beat them join them in being flexible he expanded his experience and his level of consciousness the second neighbor may get irritated he gets into a battle of wills turns his music up or just complains about the loud noise without ever opening up the possibility of a peaceful solution which will help him maintain his happiness he could possibly move away but is that not just a temporary solution what if the next neighbor also plays loud music will he move away again the first neighbor makes an internal adjustment to the external circumstance where the second neighbor makes an external adjustment that can only temporarily fix the problem internal adjustments and shifts are so much more powerful than external adjustments and shifts

i am particularly sympathetic to any rsi sufferer as i suffered from this problem many years ago when i first became an assistant at the time i hadnt even heard of rsi so wasnt aware of the possible complications it presented i developed a small pain in my right forearm whilst at work that stayed with me until i went home this continued for a few days but i soldiered on and was determined not to let it get the better of me anyway i thought who was going to do my work if i didnt in retrospect this was a mistake over the weekend the pain increased to a constant sometimes very painful ache and began to keep me awake at night my forearm slightly swelled and it took me several weeks of resting to reduce the swelling and truly get over the pain i still managed to do my work but had to type with just one hand which is not ideal when you are the only assistant in the department now when i feel the tell tale signs of rsi i rest for a while this has kept in under control ever since

if you feel you arent coping well counselling may help ive had it in the past and its taught me techniques for challenging negative thought patterns and behavioural habits id fallen into that were holding me back from enjoying life you might find it beneficial to talk about the bullying especially if you havent opened up about it before this can be a painful experience but is followed by a sense of released pressure that youve been saving up for a long time think of it as cleaning out the pipes in your head so that good things can start to get in some counsellors prefer to focus on the present and see less value in digging at the past they can teach you techniques that halt negative thinking patterns and eventually break the hold these thoughts have on your life sometimes people keep the bully alive in their minds which can prevent that person from liking themselves and being happy counselling can help you to be kinder to yourself and see things in a more balanced logical and positive way your doctor can refer you but expect a waiting list the waiting time varies depending on the services in your area private counselling or therapy is also an option if you can afford it though it can be expensive the best way to find a good private counsellor or therapist is to ask around you may be surprised by how many people have had therapies of different kinds for things like giving up smoking and tackling phobias to coping with grief and longterm emotional problems see what private therapists are available in your area try a search online many offer a free initial consultation so you can meet and decide if you like them and their techniques such as hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy before paying anything

in my experience the majority of sentence mangling occurs when writers arent sure about what they are doing i teach from time to time and come across quite a lot of mangling one way or another sometimes a student might write a fight scene but hasnt visualised it properly so tries to describe several actions in the one sentence or a writer might want to explain some element of a characters personality but arent entirely sure of what they want to say sometimes mangling occurs when someone wants to appear more erudite than their knowledge actually justifies or when they have been told that they shouldnt repeat the same word too often and raid the thesaurus for synonyms always risky mangled sentences tend to accompany mangled thinking or maybe for those of us who only think when were writing mangled writing produces mangled thinking

a lot of excellent work on patent litigation was done by the late american economist jenny lanjouw and her coauthors with britishbased economist mark shankerman lanjouw finds that of patent suits settle before trial litigated patents are more valuable than nonlitigated patents where competitors have patents citing a particular firms patent that firm is more likely to litigate to build reputation they also argue that small firms are disadvantaged in patent litigation larger firms tend to have larger patent portfolios and more resources which improves their bargaining position and the likelihood of crosslicensing larger firms are more likely to repeatedly interact with other ipr holders in their sector which again creates an environment more suited to out of court resolutions

the coronation procession makes its way through the streets of rome to the basilica as people cheer and kneel and pray and kiss the ground the popes walked on inside the basilica alexander is crowned with the papal triple tiara an awed and humbled look on his face oddly cesare watches the coronation from the audience with his family dressed in what appears to be civilian garb hes a bishop shouldnt he be participating in some way or at least sitting with the other princes of the church seems strange as alexanders new titles are announced lucrezia asks if now their fathers the holy father shell be called the holy daughter cesare says shell only change her name when she marries and shell never marry if he has anything to say about it ok thats a slightly creepy thing to say to ones sister but lets just get something out of the way here i dont know if the shows going to go in this direction but all the historical rumors of lucrezia sleeping with her brother were just thatrumors spread by the familys many many enemies who put the story around pretty much because it was the worst thing they could come up with the vast majority of modernday historians discredit the story and even people at that time mostly thought it was nonsense so i really really hope the show doesnt go there because its so cheap and tawdry and unnecessary and mucks up the image of a woman who was actually a really interesting intelligent worthwhile individual she and cesare did have an extremely close mutually worshipful relationship but it was most likely nothing more than that

a few weeks ago i was chatting with a burmese friend who told me that the tesco supermarkets here in chiang mai had no stock of mama brand instant noodles these noodles are unfortunately as they are overflowing with all manner of nonfood gunk artificial flavourings etc a massively popular staple for many people in thailand and tend to come in three main taste options hot as in spicy with shrimp andr pork gunk reallybeyondajokeinsanelyhot also with shrimp andr pork gunk and a vegetarian version that falls somewhere inbetween the other two in terms of hotness my burmese friend told me how she regularly does a big bulk buy of these noodles then journeys to chiang dao where her mother and extended family live telling me of the mama drought she seemed something close to frantic peppering the conversation with wide bulging eyes and much shaking of the head at the time i though that her distress was a tad disproportionate to the issue i mean stocks run low from timetotime and surely tesco would have some new stock soon or heaven forbid my burmese friend could buy another brand of noodles just this once

as for the ground sirloin and ground chicken breast mixture ive been doing that a lot lately as im becoming more and more health conscious you cant even taste the difference after its cooked but i feel better because i know the chicken breast is very lean not to mention its a great way to stretch your dollar and who couldnt use a little of that nowadays where i live fresh chicken breasts go on sale at least once every month for or less per pound lean hamburger hardly ever goes on sale for that cheap so to save money and still be healthy i combine the two making a lean meat mixture that doesnt taste off

there has been a theory floating around for about the last forty years or so mostly in al davis mind that you can take olympicgrade sprinters and turn them into wide receivers i can see the logic behind it theoretically they could beat any coverage or become a dangerous kick returner what it doesnt account for though is that receivers have to run precise routes and catch the ball so much of the passing game is based on timing and precision and just putting someone in whose main attribute is being lightningfast isnt enough

the rash its hard to describe someone online on message board where i found most of my information on puppps rash described it as danteesque it wouldnt calm down with ointment it mostly was more irritated with lotion or cream or gel it itched like crazy and the only thing that would stop the itching is to take a shower and cake my whole body in aveeno oatmeal bath for chicken pox i couldnt bathe yet since i had just given birth so i would stand in the steam and cake myself in this powdery goo and get relief i would take benadryl at night but then would feel the guilt of potentially passing the benadryl in my system to the baby while nursing and yes i nursed through all of this whole ordeal

breathing a sigh of relief i examined its mechanisms and read the quality control sheet and manufacturer guarantee they included here are the facts the table is supported by an interlocking canvas weave with a buoyant enough soft vinyl bed and face pillow however it is pretty vulnerable the table closes by velcro which over time will start to wear off if i am not careful to overly bump around while riding the subway and city transit i could pop a hole in the vinyl of both the table and face cradle the table can handle up to lbs of body weight but the larger your client is the more towards the ends front or back the client will have to mount the table in order to get on it because the center is its weakest point the guarantee for the table is years but if damage happens to any of the vulnerable noted points they will not replace the table the face pillow is only guaranteed for a year which is the most vulnerable of all parts because peoples faces are pressing into it for lengthy periods the pillow can be re inflated but the air hose for that is not included with the table
