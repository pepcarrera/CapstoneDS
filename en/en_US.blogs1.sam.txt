several decades ago a male researcher did a project in which he gave a bunch of blocks to kindergarten kids and told them to build bridges the boys built bigger better bridges than did the girls from this he concluded that boys had a better understanding of the work ethic were more industrious and some other stuff so a lot of years go by and a female researcher repeats the study but she watches to see what the girls are doing what she sees is that the girls are a sharing blocks and b helping each other instead of competing they are working together instead of building bridges they are building working relationships

there amongst many other things flannery explains what it means to be a quoteunquote huntergatherer vs a sedentary agricultural society he writes for instance that the problem of defining just what constitutes agriculture is an acute one when examining the prehistory of new guineatraditionally the major crops of the region have been root crops such as taro or suckering species such as bananas in order to propagate these plants one simply needs to grub them up cut off the tuber or sucker and stick the leafy top back into the ground this simple act has probably been a part of the human behavioral repertoire for years or more clearly it does not qualify a person as an agriculturalist but what is to be said of the person who returns to the newly established plant occasionally and clears competing species weeds away from it and what if they plant taro tops together does that qualify as a garden would it do so if they fenced the patch clearly the definition of agriculturalist merges insensibly into the definition of huntergatherer and it is impossible to say where one ends and the other beginsthis mobile cultivation of the landscape actually helped to generate as flannery goes on to explain a substantial part of our contemporary highly globalized fruit diet indeed he writes given the extremely long history of agriculture in new guinea it is not surprising that a number of plant foods appear to have originated there among these are certain varieties of taro sago some kinds of yams bananas particularly the cooking or plantain varieties sugar cane and various nuts some of these crops were adopted by people as far afield as africa asia and the pacific islands many hundreds of years before european colonization of the pacific new guinean agriculture has thus made an important if largely forgotten contribution to the food crops of the world

one of the sadder things i learned is that vegans are not really one large powerful group but that there are subdivisions of vegans based on their theoretical perspectives i knew that some people were vegan for the animals some for the environment and some for health but what i didnt expect was the infighting between vegans rather than using their energy to fight against the people and organizations that truly abuse and exploit animals there are some vegans who choose to aim their anger at other vegans fighting the cause in a different way

i was surprised that he did not connect this to gds showing to moses from behind but as the author admits this collection of tales is a set of tarot cards a shuffling of many themes he has already drawn upon before so perhaps in his other books over the past fifteen years he forged such a link the inconclusive speculative style of his thought on the page perhaps lacks a drama that as i have only read he possessed in his vocal presence parts of this are in latin or old irish and while some is translated some eludes those of us less educated than the causabons or george eliots of our degenerate century such on the other hand is the discipline that rewards the adept

bg there are a couple of obvious things i suppose most of the stories in walking the labyrinth were set in the south wales valleys and many of them explored issues around welsh identity and culture only a few of the stories in blindfold have valleys settings though some of them are set in cardiff and theres less of an attempt to explore those issues specific to postindustrial south wales for want of a better phrase many of the stories in this new collection are set elsewhere or often have nonspecific sometimes vaguely surreal settings im really not sure why that should be the case to be honest perhaps i felt id worked through some of those specific cultural issues in the previous collection though it certainly wasnt a conscious decision

on tuesday i decided that some speed intervals were required and so had jeff galloway he drawled that today we will be doing some race pace intervals and as the weather wasnt good i opted for the treadmill i had put jeff and his easy k away but now that the evenings are stretching out i have more time for longer runs and so out hes come again its nice having that structure one of the other reasons why id stopped using the app was because it was pushing me too hard and i was becoming despondent scratch that i was pushing myself too hard as usual id got my heart set on subbing minutes for my k from a minute pb rather than aim for minutes i was aiming for attempting to knock minutes off my time and i was near killing myself in the process i am now wearing my sensible hat have readjusted the app and its now set for minute miles with any luck one mile will be minutes long the difference as i told my husband afterwards as we soaked in the hot tub who needs ice baths was that i could easily manage the race pace sprints in the middle of the run instead of struggling to finish them and sometimes even stopping to walk during them

the result of the business cycle is that peta wins donations and reinforces their reputation as the watchdog over industry enabling them to perpetuate the cycle indefinitely nonvegan donors win a victory and a false sense that they are doing something to offset their own personal contribution to the hell that their innocent victims endure the animal exploiters win by increased misguided public confidence that these products are humane and by obtaining the public relations support of a socalled animal rights organization the losers of course are the innocent beings who are exploited and killed for the trivial pleasures of those who see them as commodities

but maybe thats not right either perhaps chagall is really saying that love is impossible not in a nonexistent way but rather in the sense that noone can ever truly understand it rather then that anything is possible with love love is complicated love comes in so many forms and many people dont experience love in the way that you do types of love and happiness may seem impossible to one person but completely natural to another happiness and love are personal and only one who knows themselves can percieve love in their own way and yet love is that which brings and unites people together even in differences to join as one body as brothers and sisters maybe then what chagall is really saying is do not be afraid of loves endless possibilities embrace it love is something that every now and then makes you stop for a moment you look at your life and you ask yourself is this real is this love and happiness real it coats you fills you with a blissful blessed sensation like no other and causes you to ask yourself if you are dreaming for life is so beautiful in these moments it is like living in another world living in the clouds filled with heavenly joy standing next to the musical goats

it may have shaken away the karajanness of karajan who lets face it was disliked for more than his musicmaking but it has had the unfortunate sideeffect of ghettoising the works of bach haydn and mozart so that few mainstream conductors dare touch them without applying supposedly correct mannerisms of phrasing articulation and so forth which often are not all that correct especially when applied simply because theyre a sound thats expected rather than a concept that is properly thought through nothing is more dangerous than a little knowledge i despair of ever hearing my favourite mozart symphonies being played with any real gumption again or without drums that sound like cornflakes packets or without winceworthy vibratoless string tone its possible to make a good sound with no vibrato of course but frequently it doesnt happen i am deeply unhappy about this its like being thrown into exile

the fact that we managed to beat england inside days by wickets is beyond amazing for many reasons the problems of pakistan cricket with the spotfixing scandal are well documented added to the mix was a crazy captain who retired from cricket only to return months later a mad chairman of the board who finally got replaced a coach who quit because of the mad captain and jail sentences for the pakistani cricketer involved in the spotfixing crisis what you end up with then is the normal stew of pakistan cricket power politics inconsistency and wacky decisionmaking it has to be said though that this team has been different misbahulhaq may just manage to pull of the most incredible feat in the history of pakistan cricket being forgiven for losing a match against india in the world cup under his leadership there is a calm and stability amongst the team that i certainly have never seen and i doubt few have even in the days of imran khan there was an element of drama yet at years young misbah has managed to do what so few pakistani captains have done before him get his boys to play as a team

but none the less the idea of the killing of nature by those who are guiding our policy as demonstrated in todays national planning policy framework can help us to explain our own sense of despair and rage and to realise that what they lack is not evidence but spiritual or moral wisdom we should not follow them down their bureaucratic roads to nowhere but rather affirm our shared love for mother earth and reframe our politics so that we use the power of this love to sweep away the nonsense of costing and enclosing the earth

in fact a parliamentary standing committee report on finance had questioned the legality of the collection of biometrics for creating a citizen database in december also the process of creation of a citizens database was outsourced to a third party with no means of adequate monitoring of their activities the union finance minister seems to have placed immense faith in this onetechnology driven initiative to deliver many ambitious fiscal targets but most of the uidbased delivery schemes will be pilot projects to be rolled out in a few chosen districts it is unlikely that they will improve the efficiency and accuracy of the governments gargantuan welfare schemes this year

if theres one thing that ive learnt about life in the years that ive been on this planet is that there is no certainty in fact im certain of it as much as we may try to create a solidity or a structure around our lives as much as we develop routines rely on patterns of behaviour on schedules on systems at the end of the day these things are just not certaintyproof most of us are seeking a kind of certainty dont you find we strive for a certain world because we fear the unknown we fear losing control even in the world of aesthetics we are striving for a certain outcome we create plans models schemes to ensure a kind of certainty in our work but in reality no outcome is ever truly certain and why would you want it to be i wonder for the uncertain outcome is often the most exciting we spend a lot of time in the workshops at the little cottage looking at the idea of uncertainty in creativity and design i find that most women who come along to the studio are looking for a kind of certainty theyre hoping to find the skills they need to decorate in a way that dazzles and while decorating is about accruing and testing skills its just as much about being aware of and then embracing uncertainty speak to most creative luminaries and they bring with them the same story the story of finding peace in the face of uncertainty in the face of the unknown outcome as creatives we need not to fear uncertainty but to embrace it it is in this uncertain space that the most dazzling beauty lies if you can bring yourself to let go to free fall metaphorically speaking then you find trust you find trust in yourself in your work in your life and when you trust yourself in this way then you can tap into the beauty within at any time and that i believe is the one thing that is for certain

it was of course a joy to finally see the mardi gras indians on st josephs day i have to admit a small bit of disappointment when i followed the indians on st josephs i saw a cinematographer from treme at the parade i assumed that the footage of the parade i attended would be aired during the st josephs episode nope no idea if they plan to use the footage in the future i can only say that the daytime parade i attended was packed compared with the nighttime parade they used in the episode so it wouldnt have represented the struggle to come back from nothing this year the indians were plentiful as were the crowds if you havent already seen the footage of that most amazing day it is my favorite video watch it full screen

im not doing well with my everworsening health situation but i must say that ive gotten enormous comfort over the years by reflecting upon other peoples misery based upon my own experiences and what ive read ive learned two things about chronic pain theres often very little that doctors can do to alleviate it and the only limit to how much pain a person can experience is determined by the point at which he passes out and even then he has to wake up again ive read about people whom if i were them and had i been able to use a gun on myself i would have run to that gun i draw two conclusions from such somber reflections one is that im lucky compared to how bad off i could be the second is that to truly allow the knowledge of such pain into my heart has made life seem a lot more serious when i was young i pretended that life was simply a game that i would someday tire of and then go back to my real existence but no our lives are as realand sometimes as horrificas when a leopard crushes the windpipe of an impala

immediately after the game while bynum was interviewed by the local tv station he drops some profanity before the station could mute him he might not see this as a big deal but he needs to consider the children who are watching this game kids today look up to athletes as role models they will emulate anything athletes do because we put them on a pedestal andrew bynum needs to mature before he can take the next step to superstardom
the human body is a temporary one that houses the spirit that god gave it and that spirit will return to god while the body goes back to the dust from where it once came whether through martyrdom as some early followers of jesus would clearly suffer or through old age even beyond ad jesus the son of man would come and receive those who remain faithful unto death continuing his relationship with us beyond this life and into the next i could continue developing this much further and probably will when this all gets put in book form but for now this should suffice for now

combine the heavy whipping cream and milk in a medium bowl with a lip and set aside in another medium bowl yes a second bowl the amount of dishes youll dirty in this recipe is daunting in itself whisk together the egg yolks egg and cornstarch until well integrated and frothy heat a large heavybottomed saucepan over mediumlow heat and cook the sugar salt and cup of water until the sugar dissolves turn the heat up to mediumhigh and continue cooking without stirring for or so minutes swirling occasionally to ensure it cooks evenly the mixture will look a bit lava like bubbling up and what not but this is totally normal just let it keep doing its bubbling lavalike thing until it turns a deep dark caramel color reduce the heat to low and slowly add the creamilk in a steady stream whisking constantly to integrate with the caramelized sugar take caution to not add it too quickly the pan will be very hot and the mixture can very easily bubble over i know this because it bubbled over a bit for me oops continue whisking and cooking for a few more minutes over medium heat again attending closely to it so it doesnt boil over and make a horrible mess all over the stove and possibly the floor turn off the heat and ladle out cup off the hot cream and sugar mixture and gradually add to the eggs whisking constantly so the eggs dont scramble continue adding the cream until half the mixture has been incorporated then gradually add the eggream back to the saucepan continuing to whisk constantly to keep the texture smooth this is especially important if you plan not to strain the pudding like some of us lazy folk ahem me cook the custard over medium heat for a couple more minutes until it start to bubble a bit and takes on a consistency thats thick enough to coat the back of a spoon remove the custard from the heat and whisk in the butter and rum

keleche osemele is a massive player standing a stout lbs making him a homogeneously large object to get around the first thing you notice about osemele is his incredibly quick hands as he shows the natural ability to strike and deliver a violent punch move that stuns and knocks his opponent offbalance osemeles hand to hand combat skills are very good as he is able to reposition his hands and get good hand placement on his opponent the issue that will keep osemele from sticking outside in the nfl is his lack of mobility and overall athleticism his lateral agility and ability to plant and pivot is lacking and his feet seem a little heavy as if theyre stuck in the sand sometimes this inability to redirect leaves him susceptible to getting beat inside as his movement skills are below average i also noticed that osemele doesnt show the best awareness or look necessarily that comfortable on the outside where he made some mental mistakes in this game on one occasion osemele abandoned his zone and chased a defensive lineman that was stunting to the inside by leaving his zone he completely left his area unoccupied and open to a blitz where his quarterback had to scramble for his life to escape the rush on another play later in the game the defense was showing an overload blitz to osemeles side when he failed to pick up any of the three players that were attacking his zone these two examples make me believe osemele might be lacking in overall awareness and blitz pickup where he seems to get overwhelmed or play undisciplined in some instances keleche osemele also does not fire out of his stance to quickly and his lack of overall athleticism and mobility concerns me to a certain degree with players who can beat him to the inside with their sheer quickness and explosion off the snap on the few occurrences when osemele was allowed to run block he did a nice job firing out of his stance and seemed to show much more passion and enthusiasm for getting his hands on someone and driving them off the football osemele does need to stay more balanced as tends to stand up and get a little upright in his stance allowing defenders to get around him with relative ease and missing his assignments here osemele needs to stay more in control and be more balanced as he tends to get off his feet from time to time osemeles inability to change directions very efficientlyuickly are concerning to me and i worry that he has a lot to work on from a technique standpoint overall his upside and ceiling is high but he is a pretty raw prospect overall that needs some work osemele will be a player to watch closely leading up the draft at the various events that prospects are invited to participate in

a commenter on the last grits post suggested that a key reason the number of traffic tickets written by texas police went down last year in austin and elsewhere may have been cuts to the selective traffic enforcement program step which are federal passthrough grants distributed to law enforcement through the texas department of transportation to pay for overtime devoted to traffic enforcement and indeed that may partially but not fully explain the recent decline in traffic tickets written by texas police

this the middle section of the novel is why the berlin crossing is being pitched in certain quarters as a thriller of the le carré variety but i think it will become quickly obvious to any fan of the classic spy thrillers that thats not the kind of novel brophy had in mind certainly he seems more than happy to play with the tropes and conventions of the spy novel the secret service spooks in london recruiting unwilling spies via blackmail the east berlin setting the secretive missions false identities and dead letter drops the sense of claustrophobia and paranoia but any fan of le carré ambler et al will be underwhelmed by the berlin crossing as a spy novel

cat clarke is an edgy writer and thats her strength she doesnt write tidy stories where enemies are safely dispatched and a happy ending is guaranteed for all she writes in shades of grey and the result is honest and raw narratives where things get messy and hearts get broken sometimes readers hearts even the love story that unfolds alongside torns central mystery is conflicted brimming over with bittersweetness of the most poignant variety like entangled torn sees its teenage protagonist forced to confront uncomfortable truths about herself and in both cases that makes for fascinating reading but where torn surpasses entangled is in the way it takes us on our own journey of selfdiscovery the way alices story feels as though its only one wrong decision away from being our own seriously scary stuff

 i read recently in the that st pauls hospital in vancouver plans to open a hour dropoff room where women can abandon their newborn children anonymously my initial reaction to reading this was shock general shock about the whole topic im not an ostrich with my head in the sand i know that things like mothers abandoning their babies happen it just caught me off guard reading about such awhats the word im searching forblunt maybe solution i went on to read that safe haven policies exist in all us states as well as several other countries like britain and japan now having read that it surprises me that canada has not yet got anything like this in place however the anonymity of the st pauls service will be a first in north america the article says that hospital officials do not think this service will be used very frequently and that they hope that it wont be used at all wow this really gets me thinking about a lot of things makes me want to hug my children makes me want to hug the next teenage mom i see not to imply that its only and always teenagers who go this route and makes me very very thankful that i have been lucky enough to be able to conceive and carry three pregnancies to term and have them result in three healthy children never mind the piles of laundry the messy floors the daunting utilities bills the petty annoyancesrievances with your neighbours or your coworkers or your spouse etc gotta find a reason to stop each day and be thankful there but for the grace of god go i

ever since i was little when people would ask me what i wanted to be when i grew up i would always answer by saying that i wanted to be a mom of course as i got closer to adulthood i continued to want to be a mom but also knew that i needed to be an independent woman and that meant finding a career after changing my major about one million times i finally decided to become a child life specialist and then finally an occupational therapist i was lucky enough to land my dream job immediately following school and have worked in early intervention ever since i absolutely love what i do and feel that i am doing exactly what i was meant to do it just fits me however ever since having zander i have constantly felt torn about working full time and now that i have grayden i am feeling even more torn i want to have a career and be a successful woman who can support myself and my family however i also have a constant desire to be home with my boys i dont want to miss out on all the fun stuff that is happening with their little lives i dont want to ever look back and regret not being there we are very lucky in the fact that the boys attend an amazing in home daycare center where they are receiving the very best care from one of my friends kristy however it is so hard for me to know that they are with her hours out of the hours that they are awake during the day so that means if you subtract the time it takes me to drop them off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon i get a total of hours with them during each week day i am lucky though because i do get many breaks during the school year and summer where i have weeks at a time to spend with them but during the times when i am working many weeks at a time i am finding it very difficult

the attacks havent drawn media attention because they are in violation of a crucial liberal myth the one holding that liberals are the leading contemporary apostles of nonviolence and peace holding the line of rational behavior against the assaults by all manner of rabid elements almost all of them right of center weve heard that one to the point of exhaustion its an unspoken axiom of american politics liberals inhabit the isles of the blessed where the lion lies down with the lamb and willie horton is only a ballplayer wearing white togas and discussing conflict resolution in low melodic voices and the rest of us were somewhere off in the depths of mordor on a perpetual rampage following the demagogue of the moment these days that would be glenn beck waving a musket and sarah palin lugging whatever it is you use to shoot wolves from the air thats the great divide in american politics from the liberal point of view one as sharply defined as the gap between the eloi and the morlocks and as permanent all they need to do is point to joe mccarthy who started out as a new deal democrat lyndon larouche who helped found the students for a democratic society and timothy mcveigh a rabid atheist mcveigh refused to see clergy before his execution and demanded that the old atheist chestnut invictus be recited at his funeral he actually thought he was going to get one of those

the famous mos eisley cantina scene has been through quite a few revisions in the original han solo shot greedo before the rodian bounty hunter could shoot him thus immediately and beautifully establishing han as an antihero in the special edition han shoots a fraction of a second after greedo thus immediately establishing han as a kind of antihero with great reflexes in the bluray version the scene reaches its inevitable conclusion han doesnt shoot at all rather he delivers a devastatingly rakish smile and greedo simply dies of a tragic completely unconnected heart attack

laura wood wants men to man up for in a nutshell the good of society perhaps if it were more evident that society gave a tinkers damn about men they would be more willing to do so
as for question five the reason i asked all this info is because if you are already living together then both of you splitting the bills should be a natural thing when i moved in with my girlfriend after a month of dating we immediately sat down together as we began discussing what the bills were rent electric water etc we divided them up and both contributed she currently makes more money than i do but with all my checks i contribute as much as i can and we work it out together obviously if you do not live together this could be problematic my suggestion is after you inform him you are pregnant it would be wise to give him a few days to let everything sink in after he has time to get a grasp on being a father i would sit down with him and present the idea of living together especially if you have plans of wanting to marry him there is no better way of telling if things are going to work out with another individual than living together by doing this you find out everything you need to about a person likesislikes cleanliness how well you are in each others space etc
 the biggest reason its the worst is because it took something so awesome and with so much great background had infinite time money and scope to really get it right and failed miserably it was boring it wasnt funny the action scenes were sooo bad when you compare the fights in this one with the sword fight between orlando bloom and depp in curse of the black pearl youll see what i mean there was no rhythm there was no heart to any of it

as many of you know i live on a mountain its pretty secluded especially in winter we have to maintain about two miles of road its not your average straight flat road either theres a couple super steep parts a little dam and lots of twists and turns but really thats not so bad its the windit makes it really hard to keep the road open so we usually end up snowmobiling or skiing or just plain walking which can be really fun and sometimes not so fun when its freezing cold and the snow is tearing into your face like little shards of glass and you have kids and groceries to bring safely home from your car youve parked miles away it also makes you write run on sentences so this year my husband and i decided that it would make life easier and maybe my writing would improve if we moved for the winter to somewhere that the roads are plowed by someone other than ourselves brilliant arent we

so i made a promise to myself i would do right by this little girl granted ive been on the road to loving and appreciating myself for a few months now but having a visual reminder made me realize how important it really is for me to be on this road if im ever going to truly live and love life and if im ever going to fully reconcile my childhood self with my adult self its still a little sad looking at those photos of me just because i think of all the time i lost in choosing to not appreciate myself but knowing that ive been actively learning to have grace and love for myself in the last few months helps to take the sting away and even though i havent been going on too many noteworthy adventures of late learning to choose adventures over fear in everyday life is helping me to do right by that little girl and by me

i have to give props to this place it really is great for wheelchairs ramps and parking and then a platform that rolls right on to the train its bench seats rather than dining car type seats but we didnt care we were happy to be able to ride at all if you want the least amount of people i recommend the earliest train of the day but even so it was fine there was room for all of us and we all had fun the train was loud and rambunctious full of kids perfect for us for those who have wheelchairs in colorado i definitely recommend it

i would propose that while those who have been laid off are looking for work why not use that extra gift of time to either spend time with family andr volunteer instead of sitting at home being depressed about your own situation and spending energy worrying why not go to your favorite organization and see how you can serve if you dont have a favorite organization ask around or see what area you would like to help with and find a group that does that even if you have no transportation find a place close by or find out if they can transport you there or find things you can do to help from your own home not only that but when you complete your resume you have something new to add you could show a potential employer that you have made good use of your time off and are creative with your time rather than sitting at home wasting time

the best places to meet women that you might actually want to date are at clubs and organizations that you belong to you will already have something in common with them and will have had the opportunity to see them interact with other people and that tells you a lot about a person if you arent already involved with any clubs or organizations the for heaven sakes join some find ones that are all about something you are interested in there are clubs and organizations that cover just about anything you can think of from astronomy to zoology and single women are involved in all of them
what an intriguing thing to say in some ways i definitely agree i mean there is certainly plenty of artistry in parenting at least more than there is science but molding your children is something i struggle with i mean a child is not a piece of clay to be molded at your desire into your ideal image or any other one these and other metaphors some artistic some not and most of them seemingly nonthreatening are woven all throughout mainstream parenting culture while they do provide us with some ready sound bites to describe what were going through however there are no metaphors that accurately capture what i try to do as a parent

a lot of new infatuations did occur blue note record label see earlier secret museum orse fly but certainly the biggest was a cd collection that i stumbled upon from the german membran label every jazz song that charted from to was included on this epic compilation of old ragtime swing and jazz tunes detailed liner notes helped bring the music of fletcher henderson benny goodman and hundreds of others back to life we are now quite a bit away from the original explosion of the swing band era but all i can say is that current bands like arcade fire and maroon forced me into cannon balling toward the past for new kicks the biggest disappointment has to have been the recent cd from hobbs new mexico native ryan bingham titled junky star he was on an upward flight after releasing roadhouse sun and sharing a grammy for his song in the movie crazy heart but this was a step in the wrong direction he abandoned his slashing rock band sound for a mostly dull collection of late night campfire songs that could only be recommended as a sleep aid

i guess the final analysis of my thoughts on this will have to wait until i read the book but i can say that going into it the platitudes that are thrown about regarding divorce and kids get on my nerves no they are not resilient no they do not bounce back no it is not better for them inherently no they do not look at it as having two new families no they do not see your new spouse as being a great new family memberriend no no no all of that shit is said to soothe the guilt of those who are making decisions for their own happiness to do what they want to do and sometimes need to do and want it to be okay for everyone else especially their kids as well its bullshit sometimes whats best for the adults is not what is also best for the kids so im inclined to see divorce as an evilsometimes necessary but many times not done for the benefit of the adults in the situation to the detriment of the kids especially when the kids are not prepared and considered in the situation as is what happens most of the time its the rare person who makes sure even while making what is ultimately a selfish decision that those who are most likely to be affected by the decision are helped through it professionally

however with just these functions it is unclear to see how these adaptations get adopted more broadly in order to get a sense of both the general stability of the community and its capacity to adapt rapidly in times of crisis we need to turn our attention to the remaining four functions the introverted judging functions and the extroverted perceiving functions have not been discussed individuals who make use of these as their primary function form slightly less than half of the remaining population with these four functions being fairly evenly distributed amongst them none of these functions have a close relationship to introverted sensation but nor is their operation opposed to it rather they seem to play the role of supporting functions

mechanique a tale of the circus tresaulti is genevieve valentines just released debut novel it is quite an original piece of fiction and once i found my footing in the world i carried away with the circus im nearly done with it and although it is short i cant bring myself to finish it as this is a world unlike any others the style challenges the reader like few do as it is at once both beautiful mystifying and horrifying ill hold most of my thoughts until my final review but if you couldnt tell i think quite highly of valentines work the closest comparison i can think of is jeff vandermeers ambergris books as mechanique is a very fractured story jumping around in time and also perspective

i say this loving dakota but she looks unable to rock shes no carmen sternwood shes not even the rather alarmingly focused creature belting out an a capella hound dog in the movie of that name my review here there are yearolds out there who are going on and there are yearolds out there going on dakota was an yearold going on but now she seems to have inversed that arc while cherie was clearly still advancing to an alarming degree maybe the studio hoped fanning would mature during the filming for certain shes due to pop into womanhood any day if she lets it happen there are ways that girls can prevent it and i shudder to think that dakotas following in so many young girls dsm ivcertified child actor anorexic stunted growth footsteps in the runaways dakotas still just a deer in the headlights not yet a shewolf eating said deer fanning lets kristen stewart do all the heavy lifting while she lies in the corner sucks her thumb and acts coy is she even having fun does she still like to pull the wings off flies are you getting all these superdroll big sleep references
when i first met my husband years ago i was working as a medical social worker on an infectious disease unit at a large hospital i was meeting patients who were learning of their hiv positive status for the first time running support groups connecting them with resources agencies medications it was a very intense job and i loved it but even with the joy that came with the idea of being in a helping profession it still weighed heavy on my heart i was learning in that year in particular how to set boundaries to leave work on time and to leave the anxiety the questions and the heartbreak at the job in the midst of all of that learning i met john as we fell in love my heart and my mind were consumed with the potential and the possibility of our relationship and i was released of the burdens i was holding close i have very clear memories of walking the halls of that hospital responding to the latest emergency but not having that feeling of dread but instead having the feeling of i have found love and all of this doesnt feel so heavy anymore i was inspired by it love and it gave me a greater sense of appreciation and perspective i felt light and joyful even with all the confusion and pain that came with my profession i like to think i was a better practitioner and person because of it

i think i took him by surprise i didnt exactly apologize for anything it was more of a fact telling moment for me apologies would come later but this conversation was significant because it was a wake up call for him he saw my pain for the first time in months and realized how far away he had wandered in order to protect himself he admitted that he was trying to just get along and not rock the boat too much other than that he didnt say much but the conversation ended with me in tears the first real tears i had shed in front of him in many many months he held me comforted me and he literally softened it was like scales fell off his skin and he chose to start feeling and seeing me again
not true in this case while this episode is clearly a robin episode through and through the episode also gives just as much attention to the team as a whole showing the amount of camaraderie theyve built up after the number of missions and drama theyve gone through each of them really cares for each other and has each others back not just in a teammate sense but in a family sense which is especially brought home by the fact that the team is undercover as a family

remember that this model is based on a smallish book with low comparable printing costs and ive assumed that youwriteon is going to price the books fairly and not ramp up those undefined printing costs a legitimately selfpublished book has a much better chance of getting into the bookshops than those which go through the youwriteon scheme because of the problems with discounts that i outlined in my post yesterday and very few selfpublished books sell as many as copies without these obstacles in their way

force begins well in fact the opening shot of john abraham clutching at a rock face reminds one of a similar shot in cliffhanger however the biggest letdown is john himself for despite his six pack structure and handsome looks he just does not emote true the character he plays is that of a tough cop who is emotionless but even such a character needs to be emoted surprisingly the best performance comes from debutant vidyut jamwal in the role of the cold and ruthless villain he certainly will win the best villain award for this year genelia is forever playing the effervescent bubbly genial girl and so perhaps script writers pen their scripts keeping this in mind even her open expression of her desire in the movie to make love to the cop sounds childlike rather than adult
mechanically thereve been a few issues with the tensioner bolts have come loose occasionally and required tightening but nothing more serious the bike is much easier to clean than it used to be in the summer we had our holiday on the gower in south wales and i planned on taking the bike anticipating some of the hills i swapped the tooth cog for the tooth to lower the gear ratio from to that doesnt sound like a huge reduction but when i tried it out around portsmouth not a place renowned for its hilly countryside i was back in rabid feral hamster mode only without the tailwind its too early to saw what the wear and tear will be but when i swapped cogs the tooth and chain looked to be holding up fine there was also no chain slippage when i used the wornin chain on the unused tooth cog try that on a cassette

the ysl vernis à lèvres lip laquers for fl oz are a curious hybrid of a stain with a gloss with the texture of a sticky liquid lipstick the glossy stain definitely feels quite peculiar on the lips and make the wearer ponder the mysteries of modern cosmetic chemistry or it could be just me my favorite way of applying the stain is to put on a sheer coat and smooth it on the lips with a finger and then top off with a more generous second coat the effect is a gorgeous glossy pout that lasts for at least hours in mint condition i cant really attest to the wear above that because a girl has to eat it also lasts reasonably well through nibbling but a larger meal would require some consequent touchups

i was a little apprehensive because i have experimented with whole wheat flour a lot in the past and have not always had the best luck using it wheat flour typically makes a denser product than white flour so a lot of times you have to use vital gluten which basically just gives the wheat flour something to bind to as well as improve the texture and elasticity of your dough meaning you will get a fluffier product rather than hard as a rock unfortunately i wasnt aware of vital gluten until recently and just used wheat flour willy nilly and then wondered why my breads came out like bricks but i got lucky with this recipe i cant say this tastes like authentic challah because honestly i dont know i have never had challah before i am sure challah made with white flour is going to be even fluffier and softer but i was very happy with my end product it was nice and crunchy on the outside but relatively soft on the inside plus i feel better about eating it because it has oats whole wheat flour and flax seed a win win win in my book but if you are not used to eating wheat flour then i would suggest doing half wheat half white flour before splurging and using all wheat flour i have been eating wheat flour for quite some time so i know what to expect

about three days after my initial posting i had already formed a reasonably clear picture in my mind of what could possibly have happened on that fateful day however considering that the police have not finalized their investigations yet i dont think its a good idea to be overtly forthright at this point in time especially if one takes into consideration that there is a year old juvenile involved whose rights have already been shamelessly violated by the media and who has already acquired the services of legal representatives to protect his rights

thats a long way to go in a minute and four seconds song is pleasantly constructed from there as well with a second verse repeat of the chorus and then a retro style guitar solo over the verse chords with no third verse it just goes to the chorus again afterward and in fact repeats the second part of the chorus as though the song was almost over already to flesh it out they play on the art school subject matter in a weird coda that extends the progressive rock aspect of the song with keyboard chords over a floating beat a bass solo and finally a fake ending

what eventually inspired me to stop procrastinating and start up the rickshaw again was attending a panel discussion in dc about pakistan led by none other than our dynamic finance minister dr hafeez sheikh and the new ambassador to the us sherry rehman the title of the discussion was pakistan the untold story umair happened to accompany me to this particular event and we both were bemused and frustrated by the level of discussion the purpose of the event a small gathering held at the world bank was to tell people that it is not all doom and gloom in pakistan i thought it was a brilliant idea get the academic community in dc jazzed about pakistan and to get them to look beyond the negativity that surrounds the country however what ended up happening was that the pakistanis on the panel began to paint a picture of sunshine and roses blooming back home ie they took positive to a whole different level

the best butter tart i ever made says sampson from a recipe by canadian cooking icon kate aitken was modest and pristine she didnt even believe in adding raisins ill argue that the ideal tart has a fairly thick shortbreadlike shell it tastes rich but not greasy its crumbly but doesnt fall apart at first bite the filling has a buttery essence and a hint of maple for canadian flair its soft but not sloppy sweet but not cloying its covered by a slight crust that gives way as your teeth invade
from the distance of decades in reading the memoir what struck genevieve most was obamas description of the gravity of that library and the vast distance between their worlds and his conviction that he alone was the one who knew how to live as an outsider she felt as estranged from that milieu as he did and he knew it and over the ensuing decades it was barack not genevieve who would move closer to presidents diplomats and industrialists the world of an insider the ironic thing she noted is he moved through the corridors of power in a far more comfortable way than i ever would have

the gift of penance being one of the fruits of this sacrifice sin ought not to hinder us from approaching but rather should be a motive for our coming to it for would it be just to hinder the sick from using remedies or keep the dead from the source of life it is by this sacrifice that we obtain the grace of penance and if sinners return from it as they come without the least change it is not because the blood of jesus christ did not cry for mercy in their favour but because they rejected it

another recent and formative book has given focus to a whole movement since dave tomlinson wrote the postevangelical in the concept has gained popularity and a conference was held in july on is there life after evangelicalism it is hard not to see here a baptised version of postmodernism with its cultural relativism and plural concept of truths instead of truth mark johnstons review of this book foundations no pp shows how the hermeneutical principles it advocates are increasingly common in evangelical institutions this is not a domestic controversy among anglicans for it goes to the very heart of our gospel authority to say the least cooperation between those wearing the same evangelical label but at loggerheads about their basic source of authority will become increasingly hard to achieve some suggest that these strains will prove too strong for some anglicans resulting in a reluctant evangelical secession the more likely outcome however will be an evangelical church within the church similar to the two anglican bodies in south africa moves towards alternative episcopal oversight in the shape of regional advisers in the reform group ofanglicans certainly point in this direction

opera and musicals are contrived forms of music theres no doubt that there is little less musically organic than an opera or musical about a time period mainly because a the music is almost always written after the time period of the play is over and thus is constructed retrospection with a good deal of tacky retrojection and b because it is very hard to organically write music when you are trying to follow a story line the story line is like form in poetry it can help with delivery and meaning but there are very few people who naturally write in iambic tetrameter it is even harder to adapt rock music which thrives on organic expression to the opera format which depends on hyperbole and constant story telling

ive never been any good at holding a grudge though i have admittedly tried in the past i have been more apt to forgive easily some would say too easily the problem was not that i forgave it was that i also forgot which meant that i stayed in bad relationships too long or looked past completely unacceptable behavior which kept me wide open for hurt after hurt and certainly to abuse there is a middle ground i believe we can forgive let go of anger hurts and bitterness and still remember that the behavior and actions were awful and that we did not deserve that type of treatment we can then make healthy choices about who we keep in our lives and who we do not keeping anger in our lives is never healthy nor is holding grudges yet may people do to their great detriment

the premise that a book can address every issue in politics according to the bible is rather bold it comes along with a wave of thought that everything christians involve themselves in somehow needs to be related to biblical principles grudem points out in his introduction that much of what he has to say cannot be supported biblically i am certainly not claiming that the bible also supports all the facts i cite about the world today with this admission grudem explains three standards he used in forming his premises biblical certainty broader principles and an appeal to facts in reality what he does is substitute broader principles for his presuppositions and an appeal to facts as philosophical arguments if it were a cake recipe the philosophical notions would be the flour his presuppositions would be the sugar and the biblical principles would be the baking powder hardly the comprehensive book it is selling itself to be certainly this cant be avoided and i wouldnt even attempt to write a book on politics suggesting that everything had scriptural support but the issue i take with this claim is grudems response that he is not going to distinguish between these three instead he leaves that up to the reader to determine if he is right but what then is the purpose of a comprehensive work claiming biblical affirmation this allows grudem to present his views to a christian audience without the strenuous effort of explaining his premises he can make an emotionally charged case without scriptural support and rest assured that he had warned his readers he would do so

this would be the final card of stormin normans career norm had already seen a serious contraction of his playing time in and in he was unceremoniously dumped before the season ended it was not a terribly fitting end to a guys career in detroit whod entertained fans for a long time both on and off the field his best moment of the season may have been when he came to the plate as the final out of nolan ryans nohitter carrying a table leg he had his huge season made a bunch of allstar teams was an offensive star in the series and twice won comeback player of the year although i guess that last one could be viewed as a mixed blessing plus norm was a friendly guy who played hard off the field as well happy to suck some down with fans at local bars that last trait would get him some trouble at the end here he reaches for an imaginary low throw during spring training showing off a mitt that looks as old as he is leaning on the batting cage behind him appears to be manager billy martin no slouch in the partying life himself

on my first visit in i ordered a bowl of chili with toast first of all ive always been accustomed to eating chili with saltine crackers and the accompaniment of toast seemed odd to me but what i got was just right the chili was robust in tomatoey chili powder flavor but it had a sweetness that balanced any spiciness quite nicely i had never tasted a chili with that amount of sweetness and i was pleasantly surprised the buttered toasted white bread made the perfect companion to the chili

i am huge fan of campy horror films but after audiences tepid response to piranha in there is little hope for the sequel to succeed usually fans flock to horror films while critics bash the film the moment the previews start yet this marks one of the only occasions where the opposite occurred based on the trailer the sequel looks even more absurd which will most likely please only hardcore horror films but unfortunately this wont translate in box office success with horror fans disappearing from the cinema more and more each year with only a million budget the gore porn flick should at least break even but any hopes for a third installment will be put to rest

for all this however sea hearts doesnt quite manage to escape from the core difficulty of its underlying myth the opposition it forces between human and seal women the characters who speak draw a stark comparison between the fleshy imperfect demanding human wives and the endlessly yielding accommodating and of course eerily beautiful sea wives and though lanagan complicates that comparison in the sea wives case by showing us their sadness at being trapped on land she cant quite get around the way the land wives seem earthy and mundane by comparison when dominic mallett the young man who returns to the island to sell his parents house tells us about his fiancée he describes her as practical cautious clever and the way that she is filtered through the narrativeespecially after he meets his sea wife who is of course ethereal and unearthlymakes these qualities seem dull and plodding

but i managed to track down the stallion station that she technically belongs to finally after calling repeatedly to every place around here that i could think of i finally managed to talk for seconds to the owner of the colt and found out which place she was from i never see him so it was quite a feat once i found that out i called the main farm and was told that i had to call another number i called that number no answer i called a second number and finally was able to get through to someone that had an idea of what was going on after some sleuthing we found exactly what we already knew her approximate age somewhere between and her color and her brand and that was it i talked to the main vet as well and he said that all the recipient mares come in on a dealer truck and the dealer didnt keep records of them either so basically we still know absolutely nothing about her except that at some point she was probably in a feedlot im glad she is no longer in the feedlot but still being a mishandled uterus isnt much of an upgrade really

for the ancient greeks mnemonic skills were an essential component of rhetorical skills in preliterate societies stories were memorized and historical records committed to memory by skilled memorizers a skilled memory was essential to scholarship until the printed word became commonplace ever since then reliance has been increasingly placed on transactive memory a term foer does not use transactive memory refers to external storage media like paper books journals storage media the internet and even fellow humans our brains remain biologically capable of doing what the ancient greeks did i should take pains to point out that although the title is moonwalking with einstein the art and science of remembering everything the book argues that remembering everything would be a mistake and might be a personal handicap but it is also most likely a mistake to rely almost exclusively on transactive memory the book states that on average people squander forty days annually compensating for things that they have forgotten although the book is fairly well documented i do have to regard this particular claim with skepticism i would be willing to accept a lot rather than the precise estimate but there might be even more compelling reasons for making greater use of biological memory the healthymemory blog argues that mnemonic techniques provide a good means of exercising our cognitive skills to include focusing attention creativity imagination and recoding they activate memory circuits and exercise both hemispheres of the brain

as of central standard time i have completed just a little shy of words in my fledgling murder mystery although well beyond the short story stage this number falls way short of the k that has become the draconian cutoff line in creating a finished novel however my meager beginning has given me a sense of where the story is headed and how the characters relate to each other who can ask for more

while ideas from the pond might first come across as congruent in terms of the consistent prominence of synthesizers and their style of programming dundov actually travels diverse terrain here often within the same track distant shores for example starts with an arresting plucking sound that soon has many layers weaving around it it moves through various stages building to a complex climax of dramatic clattering drums and lyrical arpeggios and then whispers out at the end like a dream fading away its pretty central to his charm that dundov can hit that kind of effect and have it not sound trite

this book is a popularized illustrated version of briggss an encyclopedia of fairies with more tales and fewer scholarly treatises i guess it was intended for kids born in briggs was when it was published she died a year later and her foreword sometimes brushes against that patronizing tone writers used to adopt when addressing children i hope you will enjoy the book the introduction concludes and perhaps become a folklorist collect stories for yourself and tell them to other people my second grade teacher talked like that
i was a bit worried starting the book because id found her last one the spell book of listen taylor very hardgoing thankfully i didnt need to be at all in fact i thought it was up to the same standard as finding cassie crazy though i should mention its much longer weighing in at over pages its cleverly written in the shape of exam essays meeting minutes and online conversations with themes and seemingly unconnected details and multiple pointofviews all blending to create a gem of a book put that way it sounds kind of like high literature and it could be this should be read in schools and then maybe more people would read but thats by the by because what really matters is that it is a book that teens will love
i also realized why i post three days a week the other weeks of the year it was exhausting and mentally draining even scheduling the posts ahead of time

furthermore this suggestion demonstrates an obliviousness to the privilege that christians in america enjoy on the subject of articles of dress that assert certain beliefs my friend called out jeff shott for his assertion via costume that christians are wrong but failed to say anything about the crosses that christians often wear which assert that atheists such as myself as well as jews muslims hindus basically anyone who isnt christian are wrong as a matter of fact i find many of the basic tenets of christianity which are again asserted by the wearing of the cross to be immoral and downright offensive so may i silence christians from voicing their opinions as well this is an obvious double standard

i knew about herford both before and after i discovered alberto burri but what i didnt know was herfords impact on burri apparently it was burris experience as medic in the war as well as his time in the prison camp inspired his life of painting a career that was open to impressive deft experimentation using many unconventional materials like acetylene torches plastic burlap wire dirt and acrylic caulk often paintings by burri feature elegant divisions of space in black brown cream and gold but the paintings that really jolt the paintings that in my opinion really matter are his gnarled chewed works in red and black melted plastic drippings splattered swatches of burlap and bursts of dirt and pumice the work in the art institute of chicago is still my favorite a shock of grisle and splat once owned by the chicago story teller studs terkle

im afraid its worse than we even know consider if you will that the majority of our nations industries are public institutions where ownership is traded on the worldwide exchanges we send over billion a year to countries that hate us so we can fuel what remains of our economy they in turn buy majority stakes in us based businesses either directly or though surrogates to control the continued flow of funds as economies shift if we shift to alternatives they are influential enough to direct the path even domestic wealth is not immune from deception consider tboone pickens and his current green initiatives he states hes an oil man but advocates wind power in the plains where he is a majority landowner using windmill technology his companies manufacture in addition most of his current oil industry holdings are natural gas which he advocated for transportation use

after the event i had a chance to speak oneonone with ms roliardi and a couple of the workers from the riverview center in my chat with ms roliardi we touched on some of the earlier topics and some more specific items especially in regard to some of the legal wrangling involved she said that in her experience judges are one of the overlooked obstacles and theyre too quick to dismiss charges another problem is the issue of consentthat prosecutors are in the unenviable position of having to prove a negative that consent did not happen and then the inevitable debate of what constitutes consent also any case involving children as victims or witnesses are by nature difficult to pursue

second lets remember the context of providentissimus deus and divino afflante spiritu which cites from that former encyclical pope leo is addressing instances in which there appears to be a conflict between the discoveries of physical science and certain passages of sacred scripture and the holy father says that in those instances we must remember that the holy spirit did not reveal to the authors of sacred scripture the essential nature of the things of the visible universe and thus its fruitless to seek those details on scripture because its authors did not seek to penetrate the secrets of nature but rather described and dealt with things in more or less figurative language or in terms which were commonly used at the time and which in many instances are in daily use at this day even by the most eminent men of science only examples that fit this context are admissible as part of this discussion geocentrism is a classic example of this alleged conflict between the physical sciences and sacred scripture therefore it fits the context perfectly

anyway onto the pizza so the big debate is new york thin crust or chicago deep dish now personally i have loved thin crust pizza since i was and first had true thin crust pizza in new york i even fold my pizza which my friends and family make fun of me for i actually have been doing that for my entire life and to my knowledge have never seen anyone else do that i didnt learn that was a new york thing to do until i was in th grade well i had deep dish pizza for the first time when i was in chicago at a place called ginos it was really good the crust is made with cornmeal and is a bit sweet i had black olives and spinach on my pizza one slice on a small pizza is huge it is way more filling than thin crust my verdict if you like the brick oven taste new york pizza all the way if you want more of a meal deep dish i mean its like a hearty serving of cheese lasagna really honestly i like both but i think my mouth naturally waters for a thin crust pizza maybe because i have eaten more of it or maybe its that perfectly burnt crisp taste of the crust im hungry now

where primitive clans were settled along coastlines the recurring rise and fall of ocean tides must also surely have had enquiring minds pondering whether the moon and sun had something to do with it the gifted and inquisitive minds among the various primitive clans whether situated on the coastline or inland must surely have noticed that the sun followed the same path across the sky every day at some stage most likely while they were lying on their backs preparing for sleep and while admiring the awesome beauty of the moon and other bright objects in the might sky the enquiring minds of some of these men must have recalled seeing the exact same celestial objects appearing at the exact same spot they were seen the previous night in other words that these objects appeared to be fixed in the heavens the science of astronomy was on the verge of being born as these men pondered what exactly the purpose of the sun moon and stars were and how these splendid heavenly objects could be utilized for a purpose

one can scarcely blame them for so doing apartheid in any form is a wretched and dehumanized business but the point is that it is also tragic to see the achievements of the civil rights movement have now been turned so topsyturvy that claim to minority racial status is a way to attain privileges not necessarily earned nor merited it is sad to see so much pretending and fakery substituted for the american ladder of opportunity too many are yes great pretenders

unfortunately this kind of teaching is all too common in the church and people are all too eager to receive it it is true that god has blessed us and wants to bless us but why does he want to bless us the genesis passage makes it clear so that you will be a blessing and all the people of the earth shall be blessed through you gen what a different perspective the passage brings when we read the whole text we are not blessed just so our name can be great and distinguished we are blessed so that we can be a blessing to others this is the testimony of the entire bible from abram on god unfolds his plan to bless the nations through his people whom he has blessed the kind of preaching and teaching i saw on tv is exactly what made god so upset at israel in the old testament they kept thinking they were blessed only for their own fame and because of their special status as gods chosen people but gods plan always has been and continues to be that he blesses his people so that they can be a blessing to others and bring glory to gods name

last sunday i woke up early to jog ive been trying to lose weight lately so i thought that a jog would be beneficial for my goal but that was just a secondary reason why i woke up early on that particular day tito ortiz was scheduled to slug it out against rashad evans while sexyama will attempt to cement his status in the ufc as one of its middleweight contenders ufc was the reason why i was up by am last sunday i was really excited with the match ups especially with the ortiz and evans bout since their first fight ended in a draw last another thing that got me fired up was the fact that ortiz was coming from a terrific performance just a month ago at ufc the images of ortiz squeezing the air out of bader was still fresh in my mind after all that was just a couple of weeks ago it was interesting to see ortiz fight again since i consider him as one of the most entertaining mma fighter around

what has happened at darlington is tragic i have always followed darlington by default as until recently they often sat in the same league as my team brentford they had a perfectly good small league ground that held at least is my estimate they then were built a huge ground seating just off the a sort of in the middle of nowehere decent stadium for sure but never needed now it seems they will go into liquidation and at best emerge a few leagues below with or without their huge ground tragedy and travesty the last time i was at darlington it was a happy day brentford won to win promotion to league a few years ago football needs to look at its soul so much money goes into the top end that folks forget the real end even today there are plenty of premiership footballers not all even in the firstteam whose single salary for season would be enough to save darlington although recent crowds have been maybe less than the original fan base in their old stadium feethams was around these people deserve a football team and one can only hope that a pheonix club arises from the ashes in the manner that chester city are also doing there is little more to say than this is a really sad day

i think that is missing in most young mothers we sort of come up with this idea of martyrdom when we take on the role of mother its not good if we have too much fun or think of ourselves first or ever think that something else is more important than our children we dont want to be judged by others for notdoingeverythinghumanlypossibleforourchildrenlikemakingsuretheirsandwichcrustsarecutoff most psychologist and marriage counselors will tell you that mothers should absolutely not do that where they put their children as the most important aspect of their relationship but we still do it often other child specialists tell us that we have to let our children fail on their own that we shouldnt protect them from life and that our children need to learn lessons the hard ones on their own however our worlds have become childcentered and positively driven and run by the needs of the littlest ones in the family i cant even sit down for minute straight at any given meal because i will be getting up and down multiple times for multiple things while i try to shovel food into my mouth and take care of my family

bolivar is known as el libertador the liberator the spanish crown had ruled its american colonies through vice regencies with the former aztec empire the former incan empire and buenos aires being the three largest onefifth of all of the gold precious stones and other wealth extracted from the americas were the property of the king the viceroys who represented the king and were appointed for five year terms and other key holders of power had to be not only pure europeans but they had to have been born in europe europeans born in latin america were referred to as criollos or creoles although they might accumulate great material wealth they could not hold political office this sense of political disenfranchisement as well as spains insistence on being latin americas only european trade partner led to a growing sense of alienation and to the calls to follow the example of the colonies of north america by gaining independence from spain
developing courage is a result of the practice not a prerequisite to practicing though i have to constantly remind myself of this facing fears seems to be just part of the process in asana and meditation in meditation if we sit with ourselves long enough anger rises things we didnt even realize we were angry about begin to surface anger is just a reactive emotion to the underlying emotion of fear in asana practice fear might be mindfulness in disguise think chakrasana thank you catherine or it comes in the guise of frustration when we cant bind marichyasana d fear that we cant complete the series

similar movies not a movie but remember the carjacker scene from six feet under the one that traumatized the gay son who went on to play dexter in the series dexter this movie is a lot like that not quite as intense perminute but way longer
an interesting aspect of the film is that the character were supposed to be sympathetic toward really isnt such a nice guy much of the mayhem in the film comes about because he was more concerned about his career prospects as advancing as a prosecutor than seeing justice done for the brutal rape and murder of a mans wife and little daughter jamie foxxs character clearly accepted a plea bargain for one of the killerapists primarily because he was concerned first and foremost about his conviction rate its hard to like this character within the context of the movie especially when he constantly comes across as a sanctimonious hypocrite without much to balance that out similarly the other character for whom we might be able to feel some sympathy toward the widower father who feels the system has let him down is psychopathic terrorist who is ultimately far worse than the scum who took away his family when it comes right down to it this is a film where our sympathies lie with the poor saps getting mowed down as a result of what these two men do that is another reason the film feels unstable and directionless in the middle because without a clear set of genre conventions to guide our expectations and without a main character to root for andr hate more than the opposing force arrayed against him one cant help but feel there might be better ways to spend your time

i would suggest instead that interpretatiostyle syncretisms are more like translational realities rather than equational realities some might wonder what the difference is and if it is simply a matter of semantics but let me give you an example from the modern world instead to show the difference if i were to say that luke skywalker is the wesley crusher of the star wars universe first of all youd probably be terrified and horrified at such a comparison depending on whether you liked star wars or star trek better but if one steps back for a moment one can see that some analogizing is going on here but not necessarily equating yes use of is makes it a metaphor rather than an analogy but recall that metaphor is simply the greek exact equivalent of the latin term translatio which is to say carrying across it is a manner of creating common meaning between things but not necessarily making something completely into something else no matter how much i say im a bulldozer in a certain situation that does not turn me into a bulldozer likewise saying that luke skywalker is the wesley crusher of the star wars universe does not make luke into wesley does not suddenly mean that dr crusher is his mother and therefore is padme amidala or that therefore darth vader or obiwan kenobi is captain jeanluc picard it simply states that there is an analogy and one can understand the role of the other if one is not familiar with it by this other typologically similar image this makes of such syncretisms through interpretatio not soft polytheism as many accuse syncretism in general of being but instead a kind of typology early structuralism or even archetypalismbut with the important difference of stating that these things are different but they have certain similarities this more metaphorical more nuanced understanding of interpretatio syncretisms and of syncretism in general is one that can be potentially very productive for modern polytheists and can also be useful in understanding how the various ancient european peoples analogized their deities and yet still could have seen them in ways that preserved the integrity and distinctiveness of each figure some didnt of coursejulius caesars example cited above for example but the ontheground altar inscriptions often did do this in a more thorough and attentive manner

 the guy fawkes mask celebrated in the movie v for vendetta and becoming a near universal symbol of rebellion has also been closely associated with the hacking collective known as anonymous both ad busters the canadian antiadvertisement collective and anonymous have been the moving spirit if not direct organizers of the original occupy wall street the poster artfully uses an old arcade video game metaphor to shout out the relevance of computers to the occupy movement the words hack the day are a reminder of hacks twofold meaning in both the virtual and wider world commonly a hacker is someone who breaks into or disrupts normal operationsfitting perfectly with a call for a general strike but perhaps more importantly a hack is also a provisional solution to a systemic problem one thing weve seen over and over again at the occupy sites is the brilliant and provisional nature of their solutions to restrictions imposed by a mostly antagonistic environment fittingly the wall street bull looks as though it is being levitated or is under attack by a guy fawkes mask
the issue is less crucial for someone like jonathan gold who over the last few years has appeared to have largely shed his anonymity once a critic goes public they are fair game for the press publishing a photo of the new new york times critic sam sifton however is an entirely different story not only is sifton anonymous eater apparently lied in wait for him while he was eating in order to sneak a photo prompting sifton to label them the geek paparazzi and kudos go out to lee klein and our own irene virbila for managing to completely avoid eaters prying eyes

so what is the leedpac is it what it seems why have its listed proponents and financial backers flocked together do they have a stereotypical commonality other than pure altruism could the leedpac actually be a grouping of individuals who have vested financial or other interests in the outcomes of the coming elections both in may and in november one typecast observation is that the leedpac is about maintaining a certain degree of control on economic development in leecounty are they the socalled establishment good ole boys many of the leedpac people have heavy financial interest in how development will transpire in the county that doesnt sound altruistic rather it sounds eerily like keeping control on how money is made and who gets to make it it also sound eerily like it entails how public tax dollars are spent and who gets to benefit from that spending is the leedpac a trayvon hoodie hiding something unknown with unknown intent maybe its time to know just how innocent or sinister this group is perhaps someone will publish a column exposing just who these shadowy leedpac people are and identify the businesses they run inquiring minds want to know

anyway i took a songtheuw to a breakfast place after finishing breakfast i took another songtheuw to a stop not far from the spot on the map i had that identified a bus station for transportation to rayong after walking in the heat for some time i soon realized that there was no bus station at the location corresponding to that on the map so with a certain amount of good grace i took another songtheuw to the bus station that i departed to chiang mai a week or so ago i reasoned a bus station is a bus station and someone there would know where the rayong bus departed from as i speak virtually no thai and the bus station ticket people very little english there was a lot of gesticulations and i was sent across the road to another bus station on that side that sent me back to where i had started so exhausted hot and covered with sweat i decided to buy a bottle of water to quench my thirst call the trip a failure and return home since it had been about two hours since i had left my apt and i had still not gotten out of pattaya so i sat on the curb beside the road to drink my water before returning home and while sitting there a bus pulled up and the conductor jumped out and said rayong i jumped up pleased at my good fortune and rayong koh samet so that he knew my ultimate destination yes yes rayong the responded and ushered me on to the bus and collected for the ticket the ride to rayong took and hours instead of napping i stared out of the window the entire trip in anxiety that i may miss my stop or something my nervousness was not helped by my seat mate an overly large thai soldier in his jungle fatigues who was probably returning home but that did not make me feel any better we arrived in due course at the rayong bus terminal i got off the bus and started asking for koh samet and the gesticulating began again i followed the pointing that led me out of the terminal and hope began to ebb again at the curb was a songtheuw and an old man pointing me into is with the magic words koh samet i was not home free yet because i still had to find the ferry terminal when i reached the shore upon arriving at the shore we drove along it for a while until i spotted a sign koh samet information that looked familiar it was the ferry terminal i left the songtheuw paid for the ferry ride and was escorted to a small wooden top heave overloaded ferryboat standing a short way off the wharf to get on to the ferry i had to climb onto the roof of another ferry tied to the wharf climb part way down the other side and then leap about two of so feet onto the very overloaded ferry no mead feat for a yearold man but leap i did and was caught by a large australian man who said ere you go mate you aright mate and a lot of mate this and mate that actually act it sounded more like might this and might that or it could have been mite which is what i felt light anyway i was thankful for the might of these mates for safety of this mite i cannot believe i just wrote that i shall sleep sounder this evening for that

scottish football fans have had something of a reputation in the past for being um passionate about the teams they support most prominently the fans of glasgow teams celtic and rangers while one can appreciate a little mindless healthy competition between gaggles of admirably supportive fans the fur starts to fly far so often between these two groups that its impossible not to ignore it were at the point that national news is headlined by stories of letter bombs being posted to members of celtic fc designed as stated to cause harm as letter bombs generally tend to be sitting shouldertoshoulder with international events of real standing all this over a sport designed with friendly competition in mind

one of the things i specifically wanted to do while i was in dc was attend a church service at the national cathedral we take students there every year but we never get to actually see a service i even mentioned this in my grant proposal so today was the day getting there isnt the easiest thing in the world though i managed to get to the right metro stop but once again the bus system was my downfall when i had to transfer to the bus i was at the wrong stop and by the time i got to the right one the bus was gone and the next one wouldnt come until after the service started at i thought i gave myself plenty of time to get there but no luck by the time i got to the cathedral it was there was another service starting at so i figured i would kill some time ive gotten good at that until then the usher however told me to go right in the service was being held in one of the smaller chapels near the gift shop in the basement the episcopal service is very similar to the catholic mass so i felt very comfortable i got there just as they finished reading the gospel so i was prepared for the reverends homily but this was the contemporary folk service so the homily was actually a discussion the reverend engaged the congregation and asked them questions and for their thoughts it was a very small chapel so it was very intimate and interesting after that i also attended the more traditional service in the main church wow if i can figure out the bus system i would love to go to another service

stigma also impacts survivors who have lost someone to suicide at a time in their lives when their world has been shattered many have no clue what to say or do survivors are not looking for you to fix anything instead they need support compassion and a lot of love to get through this life altering experience many try to comfort but use inappropriate words which add to the hurt if you know someone who has lost a loved one to suicide please just be there for them let them know youre sorry for their loss that is all thats needed let them talk about it openly and just listen hug them dont tell them you know how they feel unless you yourself have experienced suicide just be a safe place for them to fall
the day before halloween he told me he wouldnt be able to come back to visit because it was getting colder outside and his mother didnt want him to play outside anymore but he would come in costume to trick or treat the next evening and i would have to guess what costume he would be wearing i didnt guess the right answer and he left without me knowing which kid he was at my door the next night i suspect it was a ghost because when i thought about it later that night it was the one thing i didnt ask him and the most obvious

on sunday barack and i raced and i won i ran so fast my body transformed itself onto another plane we ran he started off behind me and i just said to myself stay ahead stay ahead and my body became a flat thin box wmy arms and legs coming each precisely from a corner and i didnt know how long i could keep it up but i was going to trymy whole sight concentrated on the lamp post when i felt him slow and yell you beat me at first i thought he was giving up but then i realized hed meant the lamp post on the left and id really won the feel of the race was exhilarating but i didnt feel very victorious barack couldnt really believe it and continued to feel a bit unsettled by it all weekend i think he was more startled to discover that i had expected to win than anything else anyway later in the shower before leaving to see the bostonians i told him i didnt feel that good about winning and he promptly replied probably cos of feelings of guilt about beating a man in which case no doubt hed already discovered the obverse feelings about being beaten by a woman nevertheless it was a good metaphor for me despite as i confessed to barack that in some ways it would have appeased some aspect of my selfimage to have tried and lost but i didnt i won

since the start of the revolt in syria the countrys alawites have been instrumental in maintaining president bashar alassads hold on power a sect of shia islam the alawites comprise roughly percent of the population and form the bulk of syrias key military units intelligence services and ultraloyalist militias calledshabiha ghosts in arabic as the uprising in syria drags on there are signs that some alawites are beginning to move away from the regime but most continue to fight for assad largely out of fear that the sunni community will seek revenge for past and present atrocities not only against him but also against alawites as a group this sense of vulnerability feeding alawite loyalty is rooted in the sects history

the foundation for our universal interest should be the desire to be after gods own heart and to do all things that are pleasing to him when i think of denominations i automatically think of division once we ask someone a question and they give us an answer we sort their answer to make sense of it and to accumulate it to our memory i am sure everyone has their own personal reasons for choosing to associate with specific denominations but i challenge everyone to think about what makes a methodist different from a lutheran and both of them different from a presbyterian there is only one god how can there be thousands of segregated denominations serving the one true god but each with their own set of beliefs what does it mean to be a different type of christian or for two individuals to be christian but to believe different things god is the same god today as he was yesterday and the same god to me as he is to you he wont tell me to believe one truth and tell you to believe another he is a consistent god never changing malachi there is a space of confusion somewhere and i know for sure that our father is not the author of confusion corinthians i suggest that to prevent ourselves from falling into the pit of confusion that we each be aware of what is causing the misunderstanding gods word doesnt contradict itself so the contradictions and the disagreements are something stemming from a different spirit test the spirit by the spirit

in the few papers i did find which held some relevance for our context the results were circumspect about the overall value of preschool on the positive side there seems to be a consensus that middle class populations do derive some advances in cognitive development from preschool see this report for more however these gains are small one report estimated that the difference between children who attended preschool and those who did not amounted to the ability to answer one more question correctly on the test instrument this same study also found that this effect fades over time on the negative side another paper concluded that any cognitive gains come paired with a negative trend in measures of social development though exactly how social development was measured is not clear to me

the baby book by dr searsagain dr sears my friend gave me this as a baby gift its bigger than most city telephone books so i didnt consider reading this one covertocover no this tome is meant to be a fliptotheindex kind of resource but as i said earlier dr sears just seems very supportive of the things that i wanted to hear hes big on breastfeeding big on wearing your baby big on bonding and even advocates a family bed if thats something that youd like to try i also found his approach to food introduction somewhat helpful though his list of when and which foods to introduce varied from the pediatricians list
i thought i did but honestly i do not sitting here today recollecting the past year and all that i have done i have ultimately surprised myself i have changed so much in such a short time and my priorities have been totally redefined however i do not think it is a tragedy at all on the contrary i think not knowing what we might be like or want in a few years maybe even a few months is what keeps life interesting it is a sign of an ongoing personal change to have it all figured out at any time in our life would make for an infinitely boring existence

if were honest with ourselves were kind of embarrassed by the doctrine of hell most of us think that in order to be good evangelical christians we need to believe it because jesus and his followers talk about it quite a bit but have we ever been passionate about hell like we are with the more palatable truths of the faith or perhaps at times do we think to ourselves that if we were in charge we could do a better job than god with this whole judgment thing even still though well admit that rob bell is wrong in his assessment of hell are there occasions when we wish he were right about it not being eternal

does this ever happen to you where you think about a particular thing and suddenly lots of things related to that thing appear in your path for example an image of a former colleague will bubble up to my consciousness and suddenly out of the blue shell email me that has been happening to me a lot lately in fact a discussion not too long ago about my finding my best foundation resulted in a request to talk about my experience with laser treatments which then made me think about how my face looked before i had the laser done and then years before the mild rosacea made an appearance all these thoughts about skin and aging skin and wouldnt you know it i flipped a page in a magazine and there was christy with flawless skin albeit with an extremely offputting visual of her skin being tugged off her face by a wee bottle as though it were a taffypulling contest

the problem whittle says is that those who dont govern themselves end up creating pressure for a government that strips away those choices its a little more complicated than that however those who want government to dictate choices usually consider people inherently incapable of making those choices on their own and thats not a dynamic limited to nonbelievers either it usually comes from a misanthropic view of humanity the exact opposite of the views of men like adams and jefferson and a belief in the wisdom of elites who know better than the individuals what their selfinterests are and not because of an objective inability govern ones self but because the elites simply dislike the choices others make its that arrogance that creates nanny states

the president with respect to social security social security is not the source of our deficit problems social security if it is part of a package would be an issue of how do we make sure social security extends its life and is strengthened so the reason to do social security is to strengthen social security to make sure that those benefits are there for seniors in the outyears and the reason to include that potentially in this package is if youre going to take a bunch of tough votes you might as well do it now as opposed to trying to muster up the political will to get something done further down in the future

 at the heart of this choral song of praise we find an antiidolatrous declaration thus prayer is revealed as a way of reaching the purity of faith according to the well known affirmation lex orandi lex credendi the norm of true prayer is also the norm of faith and is a lesson on divine truth indeed the latter can really be discovered through the intimate communion with god achieved in prayer

all this is to say that i am not exactly in a position to write an unbiased review but hisham is a masterful writer in addition to being a singularly lovely person his second novel like his first deals with a libyan fathers forced disappearance and the repercussions for his son and his young wife the boy who is at the cusp of manhood is in love with his stepmother and they are just close enough in age to make the sudden absence of his father fraught with sexual tension in addition to the obvious distress the characters are flawed and philosophical and their story unfolds like a dream as they try to grasp the reality of their hijacked lives

the fourth stage involved working the first stages of the island and the water surface an underlying rule for paintings is that the closer the subject is to the viewer the more the details need to be fleshed in and appear more realistic the island and the water area are mid to foreground and thus will need lots of work thus this first foray into these areas really set the stage for further rework of course it also forms the base for that rework so it has to be pretty solid in its right again i chose to work this with wetinwet techniques to gain experience in this crucial discipline of oil painting as i mentioned before it was the last time i could do this since the detailbuilding stages would require mostlydry to dry paint surfaces
its important that we understand more about autism because it impacts all of us almost everyone knows someone with autism and it has an enormous impact on families school systems and communities whether youre trying to understand your nephew or a child in your daughters class or youre a businessperson trying to understand how to accommodate people with autism autism touches your life or it will soon the economic impact of autism which i use because it demonstrates how impactful autism is to families and communities and money is easy to quantify is now just beginning to be wellunderstood as well the autism society of america estimates that it costs to million dollars to care for a child with autism over his lifetime the united states spends almost billion each year for autism this figure includes research health care education housing transportation etc

we noted in our previous post in search of a leader with reformist vision that greece today urgently needs the healthy reformist sectors of society to come to the forefront our concern is essentially that there still has not emerged the critical mass of citizens pushing for structural reform too many have been bought offoopted by having family members inr dependent on the less productive segments of the public sector so the whole issue of reform is forced ahead only by the troika at each bailout tranche review the few greeks and focused elements of civil society which support structural reform are such a minority that they cannot it seems even form a political party so we will not let greek society off the collective hook until the consciousness shifts and those who defend poor little greece in the western media are actually doing more harm than good unless they forcefully support greeces small number of true reformers not papandreou style speechwriters the wave of creative destruction we are seeing now across the country is inevitable greeces considerable human and capital resources have to be reallocated to functions which allow them to generate something of value like it or not the free market is doing it since government here is unableunwilling to this hurts some weaker elements of greek society excessively and it may take a generation civil societygos could be helping more

all during i enjoyed a free digital subscription to the new york times courtesy of lincoln and as a reward for being an online reader for a decade when it came time to continue the subscription they offered me weeks for naturally that was too good to resist so i signed up with the intention i would take their weeks and cancel the subscription i marked the date on my calendar the only way to cancel was to call and speak with a person i took this as a plus since automated systems make me crazy the representative was helpful and cancelled my subscription and even sent me an email confirming the cancellation a few days later i received my bank statement and found on the day i called to cancel they dinged my debit card for a three month subscription i dont know if they are using this tactic with others or if this was a random occurrence but it left the impression they may not be getting the renewal rates they hoped for sadly it also diminished my opinion of the once great new york times

when a thick fog descends upon a rural community and claims the lives of anyone unfortunate enough to be caught outside a small band of survivors seeks refuge in a local grocery store now i dont normally like a movie stuck in one place except dawn of dead but this really breaks the mold of normal horror films because its not just moronic teenagers with no personality but this film gets you feeling for the characters and makes the impact of character deaths all the more disturbing if you have seen the end you know what i mean the monsters in this film are hidden well behind the mist which makes it more creepy and shocking when they strike its a horrorcifi movie of real conviction it deserves to be a hit

detox is about healing and cleansing its about learning to listen to your body as opposed to your treacherous brain and care for it as were it just a defenseless baby and if you think about it thats pretty much the way it is our bodies are under constant attack we feed them all sorts of junk give them too little rest and virtually no physical exercise then we expose them to chemicals all day long from the washing powder in our clothes to the deodorant under our arms the food we eat and the air we breathe sure we also have a body that is designed to deal with all of this but maybe not to the extremes it has been pushed to these days

and as for worshiping a god based on my upbringingit is true that if i were born in another country i would probably worship and different god than i do right now i would probably have a different holy book and follow different customs indeed my christian upbringing has certainly influenced my choice to follow christ however it was not until kazakhstan that i chose to make christianity my own belief and not just the belief of my parents in doing so and actually researching the bible and comparing it to other religions i have learned that no other religion has as much evidence for it as the bible and no other religion has as personal a god who would willingly make such an unbelievable sacrifice for the people he loves indeed there is no other figure in history who was as influential as jesus christ how do i know look at the numbers billion people have claimed christ as their savior around the world islam is the only other religion that comes close to it with billion followers as for god testing job he allowed satan to test job to bring glory to himself and to prove satan wrong and dont forget the end of the story job receives even more than he had before he was tested and was blessed by god greatly as for god killing all of the firstborn egyptians he didnt kill them because of their disbelief in him he killed them because of pharaohs refusal to let his people leave egypt and he only sent the final plague after warning pharaoh with six earlier plagues and a warning with each one pharaoh is the one who can be held responsible for the deaths of all those firstborn including his own my god is not an asshole he created the human race which he loves very much enough to send his own son as a sacrifice in order to save not only our earthly lives but our souls as well so that we could have a personal relationship with him on earth and also go to live with him in paradise when our services to him were no longer needed on earth john if you can name another religion in the world with god like that who has as much evidence in his favor id like to hear it you can check out this link for more information on the bibles historical accuracy if you like

the epo is strict on lack of unity and lack of unity is often found on biotech cases this is now more problematic given that the epo has imposed stricter deadlines for filing divisional applications when lack of unity is found examiners will tend to split the claimed subject matter into different inventions along the lines of the sequences that can be used in the invention sometimes each sequence is deemed a separate invention leading to a large number of inventions being identified this is unfortunate as there are often other ways to define the inventions that lead to a lower number of total inventions however given the present practice of the epo if the invention relates to multiple sequences then the most important sequence should be listed first either in the claims or in the description

yesterday as i was sitting in my recliner and working on my laptop i fat round black and yellow spider ran up my chair i was needless to say startled and quickly flicked it off my chair as i carefully got up to get something to squish it with my heart was beating faster than normal the anxiety was definitely going to be a problem for a little while i grabbed a paint stir stick and whacked that horrible little creature a good one grabbing several tissues i picked up this not quite dead and still wiggling creature and squished it between my fingers i then disposed of it into my garbage can im sorry but you just had to come into my domain that is an automatic death sentence for any spider i know that your death was not quick and im sure very painful and for that i am truly sorry i will do my best to provide a quick and painless death next time though for you little black and yellow spider it really wont matter
ive had a few people ask me for the homemade bread recipe that i used i never realized how easy making homemade bread was time consuming but easy this recipe made one loaf for now and one to freeze for later so im hoping to do a huge bread making day soon and so i can stock my freezer of bread then i wont have to make it every week but theres something very satisfying to me about making your own bread and i really found it fun i actually jumped up and down kind of high in the air actually haha when my bread came out looking and tasting perfect i usually ruin stuff in the kitchen so the fact that this bread is amazing is proof that anyone can do it it just takes time discipline and a desire to actually do it

i think its safe to say we all have heard the term damsel in distress at some point the term is thrown around all the time and if youve read any of my blogs focusing on fiction youll have bumped into it more than once this character was such a damsel in distress that character was great because she was so much more than a damselindistress etc but what makes a character a damsel in distress while i was throwing it around so much i realized its not always clear to people on its most basic level it simple stands for a woman in trouble but where is the line between an overworked and harmful stereotype and a capable female character who is simply human and needs help every once and awhile characters i deem a damsel in distress are more often than not much more capable than older classic damsels in distress like sleeping beauty and snow white who have become the face of the term

the question begging so typical of the macpherson report is on display it has indeed been asserted yet by no means demonstrated so clearly that the murder of stephen lawrence was racially motivated note too the thoroughly unwarranted assertion that since some of the officers did not agree they must be institutionally racist this is not argument this is intimidation and it is an ugly and pervasive feature of the macpherson report the logical impossibility of individual police officers being institutionally racist as macpherson asserts is nevertheless revealing it demonstrates that in the search for institutional and unwitting racism one individual will be enough to initiate a witch hunt in the macpherson universe any police officer who does not accept that stephen lawrence was the victim of a raciallymotivated murder must by that very fact macpherson implies harbour some dark secret he is a racist an enemy who like winston in orwells must be compelled to believe in something he holds to be false this has nothing to do with justice this is intellectual violence the sort which typified marxist sophistry if we the high priests of scientific communism are right then anybody who disagrees with us must be wrong our opponent is a class enemy an enemy of the people

it is illogical for bloom to categorically dismiss the idea of interpretation to argue that every interpretive activity is unavoidably and necessarily a misinterpretation however if we ignore this idiosyncratic and grandiloquent use of terminology bloom essentially suggests that every poem is both dependent upon yet differentore than those poems that precede and influence it old testament theology is a variation of the activity of innerbiblical interpretation just as all criticism is prose poetry the way in which the chronicler responds to certain concerns unique to their situation is both dependent upon yet differentore than the concerns that occupied those who wrote the books of kings

if you have a child who has allergies sensitivities or reacts behaviorally to certain food additives then you may feel you have to control what your child eats unless the allergy is life threatening letting go of control and respectfully providing your child with information is still an option and if the allergy is life threatening being respectful of your child when you need to protect them should be your focus children do not want to feel sick any more than an adult if they are given the opportunity to see how foods affect them and are supported in making their own choices they will almost always end up choosing not to eat the food that is problematic or will eat it mindful of the potential negative effects

from there nav and i walked over the siff uptown theater in queen anne where the nights screenings would take place at nights end i dont think ive ever been as excited about filmmaking as i was at that moment the caliber of films screened friday night was mind blowing not only were some films as high quality as professional done indie films and hollywood productions but the story concepts were fun original and creative i spent the night running between the two screening theater rooms trying to see as many of the nights films as possible the categories of the films i got to see that night were keep it cinematic sex lies angst late night comedy and late night horror theres not enough time or space on here to really delve into what were my favorites from each category and why but what i can go on about is how much tonight and all of nffty is one incredible learning experience one im getting to watch all these amazing films and hear about the processes the filmmakers went through to make them during the qa sessions and two watching these films i am connecting and bringing together all of the things i have been learning over the past two quarters as a cinemedia major my experiences in acting classes screenwriting classes directing seminars all come into play as i watch these showcases of youth talent as i watch a film i cant help but automatically analyze it for what is working and what isnt in it i have andrew tsaos voice in one ear speaking about dramatic narrative and acting and in my other ear i have shawn wongs voice speaking about elements of screenwriting and dialogue watching these films was such a learning experience for me for when i want to go and make my own stuff for example within one film i can be watching and think wow this is an incredible scene and know why its incredible why its working and what the filmmaker was thinking when hehe was creating it because of the tools i have gained from cinemedia similarly within that same film i will watch a scene and think mmmm this scene isnt working exactly right somethings off and ill know why its not working because of the skills ive gained from cinemedia each film had moments of pure awesome glory as well as moments that just missed the mark and each one taught me something different or left me with a different take away that i could apply to my future film projects

i really did not know how i would react to solomon northrups odyssey when i first saw it so many years ago after all the movie had not been directed by someone from the established hollywood community or from any of the film industries overseas gordon parks was a wellestablished photographer who had worked for life magazine and a documentary director before turning his attention to directing films and before solomon northrups odyssey he had only directed eight films his most successful being the movie shaft i must admit that parks did a firstrate job in his direction of the movie but i would not go as far to say that it was perfect

for the first time dwight described their audience in the language of partisanship previously he had maintained that music lovers existed on a continuum of appreciation based on education and prior experience but always with the capacity for growth and further refinement at this crucial moment however he recognized that alliances whether voluntary or characterbased were being drawn he hoped the next few months would show that the appreciating few fond of good music for musics sake are not by any means so very few as it has been tauntingly and often said dwights pessimism is epitomized by the fact that he dubbed those who appreciated music for musics sake members of the rival party
and then there was the work i found this part of montessori practice pretty silly the rule was that a kid could not just walk up to one of the shelves pick up whatever interestinglooking thing was there and start playing with it a kid had to have a lesson in it like the teachers were going to show kids the proper way to play with this thing and then the proper way to put it back what the show a kid how to play thats like showing a dog how to eat its adults who dont know how to play right i got in trouble for this more than once because i negligently allowed some of my charges to play with the work without my having ensured their competence to do so after all think what might have happened wiser now i shudder to think of the possibilities

on a more serious note if having an opinion is now disallowed shouldnt we just ban the internet i mean hey thats full of opinions and a lot of them have gasp swear words in them too the precious minds of adults who use the internet consentingly and should really be aware of its content are far too precious to be corrupted by letting them see words that they hear spoken every day now i appreciate that when its children fair enough parents dont want their kids picking up bad habits by seeing swearing on the internet if id been reprimanded for my use of swear words and if id been told it was a parent who had complained when their young child had seen it fair enough but when im falsely accused of slander by someone who ive no doubt should be old enough to know better and worse someone so cowardly that they dont want me to know theyre stalking me then it makes me lose a little more faith in humanity

if you looked quickly at his numbers from as compared to you would have thought that pedroia really slid down after his mvp in truth there is a lot to like from last season for one thing his bb rate shot up over from the season before i dont expect that to hold but i think there was definite improvement there add to that he was very unlucky last year as opposed to years prior with his babip taking a dive from the range to under i would expect him to have that babip jump back up to at least the range that will boost his batting average up as well and with the increase in walks his obp also his iso should remain about the same a bit north of which means with the increase in batting average his slg will go up as well this all adds up to a nicer looking season than last year projections have pedroia at ops i think he can do better than that and get closer to an with a nice obp hopefully he returns to his super successful stealing ways of as well because for that he had last year just isnt that great of a percentage strong defense as always though and no polanco to steal a gold glove means it could be pedroias to lose

from a different perspective namely that of law makers and enforcers this idea is pure genius and because of that is promoted frequently and consistently in nearly all modern propaganda including media and educational institutions if you want something done give someone the power to force it to happen those who want certain things done get to feel like something is getting done without doing much themselves and those who want the power get what they want and usually have no liability or accountability to balance their power the more we try to solve with force no matter how legitimate it might seem the more force and centralized power well get as a result

i read some reviews of this novel and i agree with some parts that were made one could say that the housekeeper ellen dean was the one who was a victim and was abused it shows when she tells the story to mr lockwood of all who were at wuthering heights and thrushcross grange but when i read farther i thought maybe she isnt the controller but she was the cause of the chaos she also was supervisor of the children

what i really love about lawrence sanders though is his use of words ive said this with authors before because when it happens i believe its the mark of a truly gifted wordsmith sanders uses words not in the standard vernacular of the average person and its what sets his work and in particular the character of archy mcnally apart from other authors and detective series just try one and i bet youll be hooked you dont have to read the books in order as each is self contained but i do recommend reading them that way because of the character development so start with mcnallys secret if i can be so bold as to give marching orders to my readers and then let me know what you think

the last time alec baldwin hosted the season finale of was the worst episode he ever hosted and that is saying something considering that he did host during the notorious season and the baldwin episode before with the jonas brothers wasnt that great either so it was nice to see a return to typical baldwin episodelevel form i am unusually excited for this season and i dont have much of a rational explanation for why i feel that way there have been no cast changes nor have there been any other significant changes so one would figure the show should be about the same as last year but i remain optimistic for this season thanks to this solid first episode most of the sketches were solid and the subpar sketches generally were not too onenote and unoriginal and this was the most receptive snl audience i have witnessed in years the support of your fans can go a long way so im going to take a cue from this audience and cheer whenever i can this season

just one more example of how sexism screws things up for everyone i guess if a man can only relate to a woman as a collection of disembodied parts hes going to have a hard time forming strong emotionally rewarding relationships if a woman thinks of her own body as being made up of disembodied parts sex is going to be really weird and awkward and not very satisfying it would really be to everyones advantage if people would learn to appreciate boobs in a more grown up way as part of the whole personxperience
when errol flynns first stab at a western dodge city proved to be a financial hit warners wasted no time in casting him in another they reassembled as many of the cast and crew from the previous movie as possible and threw in a few more stars for good measure the result was virginia city and although this one wasnt in technicolor the sweep of the narrative was every bit as epic as its predecessor its not quite the movie of dodge city but it does come close only let down by a couple of questionable casting decisions which ill look at later

the titles a bit of a deception but two on a match wouldnt have allowed the filmmakers to use a phrase apparently then in vogue the three women featured above have rather unequal screen time with bette daviss character shoehorned in as an afterthought to the shenanigans involving ann dvoraks drugaddled dissipation and joan blondell swooping in to pick up the pieces of dvoraks life which include not incidentally a husband played by warren william in a role which must have seemed like quite an acting stretch since on this occasion william doesnt play a complete cad even by the standards of the s the film squeezes an extraordinary amount of plot into an hour with leroy using newspaper headlines as one neat device to mark the passage of the years and the film takes full advantage of precode leeway with marital woes booze drugs and brutal gangsters including bogart in his hoodlum period front and center theres also a kidnapping sequence that must have evoked the tragic lindbergh case which took place earlier in for viewers of the time as a plot device its rather questionable seen against the terrible outcome of the actual kidnapping

we went into halftime leading with goals from our younger contingent of twentyone year olds chris pye and ryan hurst and twentyyear old ali ingram there was further room for refereeing analysis in the secondhalf when chris pye had a goal disallowed for offside chris was extremely cheesed off having already accepted the congratulations of his team mates and back in his own half for the restart he could only assume hed made the score comrades linesman had other ideas dressed in deck shoes jeans shirt and a grey ralph lauren tank top naturally he was quite adamant that the goal was offside leaving his flag raised until the referee saw it a long discussion between the referee and linesman followed presumably one about a brand new ruling meaning two men and a goalkeeper between you and the goal can play you offside if the assessor really was on the fifa hotline this was surely the perfect opportunity to check the rule book and pull rank he didnt the disallowed goal had no bearing on the outcome of the game either chris pye later hit the post then ryan hurst up from a corner came within whiskers of completing his hattrick this is our first league win of the season and having now scored ten goals in the previous two games we look to have found some momentum

and in many ways its that sense of release and freedom that forms much of the appeal of belle de jour theres a plot that creeps into the last third of the film one about a jealous client and the eventual clash of séverines private and working lives but in reality it is simply the speed bumps on a road of personal selfdiscovery that forms the backbone of the movie buñuels movie is a movie about a certain kind of longforgotten cinematic eroticism the languid sexual charge of unspoken possibilities and of the subtle and secret indulgences in a baser nature the film manages to be both beautiful and profane without anything resembling pornography a frankness that is concerned entirely with the inner life and desires of its protagonist the visual splendor of deneuve lounging in various states of undress more loving appreciation for her beauty than any sort of exploitation voyeurism

with the recent release of chiddy bangs first proper album breakfast and the return of asher roth with his new single party girls college rap seems to be a sub genre going from strength to strength from the moment i love college was released in early and chiddy bangs opposite of adults spread like wildfire there seemed the potential for artists who hadnt grown up in the ghettoes of new york or la to make credible hip hop covering what was relevant to them granted much of the work talks simply about girls smoking and drinking but there is still room for creativity both musically and lyrically and with the wealth of unofficial and mixtape releases out there it is a fast evolving and interesting genre to keep up to date with the frequency of release is a testament to the work rate and ethic of these artists and whilst this may not always guarantee every song is amazing its proves the wealth of talent there is

churlishness though at a time when the likes of battleship are considered acceptable as a major summer release the intelligence humour and evident love for both its source material and basic storytelling that the avengers displays throughout is not much less than a tonic for the soul marvel studios can look forward to massive boxoffice success joss whedon can look forward to his new status as a bona fide majorleague player and we can look forward to the next wave of movies featuring these characters theres one other superhero movie coming out this summer thats carrying a huge burden of expectation and possibly pitching for a more mature audience too but that looks likely to be a rather more sombre and thoughtful affair in terms of general crowdpleasing spectacle and sheer entertainment value the avengers may be the most successful film of this genre to date

it is easy to extend the above analysis to events we speak of events such as my striking the golf ball and the golf ball flying through the air but is this differentiation in fact anything other than convenient surely it would be just as correct though perhaps less convenient to speak of a single process of motion which was at first exhibited by the golf club and later in the golf ball pursuing the point even further what is necessary about the categories of striking and flying it would be just as correct though less useful to say there was an event of physical objects in motion we cut up the happening going on around us in nonnecessary ways we could cut up our clubball happening into the downward motion of the object and the upward motion of the object if we did this we would say that the downward motion of the object plus some other centripetal vector x caused the upward motion of the object it might be of no interest that in the upward motion the object as attended to was first the club and then the ball

what this article did however was spark a conversation between my wife and i regarding graffiti and art surprisingly we agreed that in the main genuine graffiti inspired art was in fact worthy of public display and as valid as cubism pollocks blue poles that hangs in the national gallery or any other art style that over the years has inspired debate now one of the glaringly obvious differences is that the art graffiti is applied to public and private buildings etc often without permission the other of course is the tagging etc that is included in the genre to me this is just defacing something that doesnt belong to the tagger for reasons that seem a little akin to a male cat spraying to mark its territory

you know how they say that its not the journey but the destination success is awesome but its not the endall beall its not just about hitting a target its also what you do after youve reached your initial goals are you just going to take it easy and switch off your motivation switch or are you going to make new goals and challenge yourself these choices represent your desire to grow as a person sure you dont always have to move on to a new project right away but it is important to ask yourself how can i do things better heres the thing people change whether you like it or not think about it are you the same person that you were years ago were never static and always remain in motion even after youve earned your first million youre either moving forward or backward although you should never take your current success for granted you do need to understand that everything you do in the present will either help you evolve or decline besides youre not the only one the rest of the world is also in a state of constant change this means you need to avoid being complacent to stay on top of your game and adapt to evershifting circumstances in many ways longterm success is not just about adding another trophy to your collection in the greater scheme of things it boils down to maintaining the same attitude and mindset that made you successful in the first place the way to do this is to stay sharp stay hungry

i say all this not so anyone will feel sorry for us but because we recognize where one of the things that we really need as a couple is time to get away time to just be us and have focused time on being together and remembering all of the reasons we ever fell in love in the first place

so the big ttttteenager question many people feel confident to homeschool or unschool the primary years but when it comes to the high school age group their legs turn to jelly i guess i can understand this in a way i mean we all dropped out of school before the high school years didnt we so we wouldnt have a clue of course but the truth is most of us if not all of us went to high school and even graduated from high school but somehow we dont feel confident to walk through these years alongside our teenagers we can so easily sit in a place of fear biting our nails and looking anxiously over our shoulder to see how everyone else is performing and looking at our own child wondering if theyll turn out okay

this loss of love is seen even more acutely in that a fundamentalist lens leads people to be suspicious and lack grace toward others in the church fundamentalism when primary creates a culture of critical inspection that fails to remember that is only by gods grace and through his spirit that peoples minds and hearts are transformed into complete and glad submission to the fathers will jesus says in john that the mark of discipleship is the love within his body toward one another what happens when fundamentalism seeps into church leadership is that the effort to uphold right behavior and doctrine actually creates a culture that is opposed to christs standard for how the church is to live

prospects love to throw curve balls at salespeople to put them under pressure during the time the salesperson is talking to himself instead of what he should be doing is to give his complete attention to the prospect and why he is saying such things the salesperson loses all objectivity and at that moment loses complete control of the sales process and most likely wont regain it the funny thing is that during the time a salesperson is emotionally involved and directed inward the prospect usually is telling them why they said what they said but the salesperson never hears it

if you ever need a reminder that god is in control of the happenings of earth as a master chess player is in control of the board you only need to look at this passage continuing the analogy i remember a time when i had the opportunity to play a real genius in chess along with about ten or fifteen other people he would simply go around the tables and make his move then go to the next board and move his piece i thought since he was so distracted with the others surely i could catch some mistake and beat him i was very wrong and ended up losing very quickly he was in control the entire time despite every counter attack i attempted he utterly won

looking out my living room window this morning i watch with awe at the powerful thunderstorm raging all around our home although it is now several hours after sunrise darkness quickly envelopes the land as the ominous storm clouds race to block out any rays of light as the sky lets loose all at once with a violent downpour the room echoes with the pounding of the rain on the roof and i find it hard to see through the quickly clouding window and the steady stream of water falling to the earth the river is now raging as strong winds whip up and cause whitecap waves to crash about while the water is simultaneously pummeled by the large powerful raindrops exploding on its surface a bright white flash fills the dark sky as lightning crackles through the heavens and almost immediately the booming clap of accompanying thunder rattles our home the lightning is so close that the thunder clap starts with the unmistakeable snap like the crack of a whip and then explodes with the earthshaking boom letting me know that i am in the heart of the storm

the matrix of stories told by hindi films has more or less remained the same there have been some bold variations on the same theme but no major departures because we are a nation of great storytellers and the stories in hindi films are a continuity of the mythology and folklore that nourish our roots and every time we visit a hindi film we tend to visit our roots again and again to refresh and enrich ourselves and to find solace and identity in them hence the same stories the same relationships the same conflicts the same values the same scenes the irony is that in spite of the predictability the audience expects to be surprised every time and that has always been a challenge for every writer filmmaker and actor how to surprise the audience while offering the same meal day after day film after film this is where one begins to admire the talent of actors like dilip kumar and amitabh bachchan who still manage to entertain and enthrall while working within such confinement hollywood is not confined by such obligations the challenge gets worse for other less talented actors who have to face a benchmark like dilip kumar they are left with no choice but to ape him and let him burgle his way into their performances actors like naseeruddin shah did make some courageous efforts to find a new route but while his craft was admired the big burglar remained unchallenged

and thats a fairly useful label to be used in contrasting christian endeavor prayermeetings to the kind of oxford group meetings and houseparties that bill and lois continuously attended from the beginning of bills sobriety in the emphasis in the oxford group meetings bill attended in the east was certainly not on prayermeetings it was on testimonies about how lives had been changed through oxford group techniques and thereby attested that god had done for them what they could not do for themselves in akron however the emphasis in their christian fellowship meetings was on bible reading group prayer topics and upstairs surrenders to christ by newcomers in sum akron aa meetings focused on bible and prayer in old fashioned prayer or old fashioned revival meetings while oxford group meetings elsewhere emphasized lifechanging meetings and testimonies the difference between east coast oxford group activity and the clandestine lodge of the oxford group in akron becomes even more clear when you look at what bill said to t henry and clarace williams when bill was interviewing the pair in bill said to mr and mrs williams

the point about the continuity of inequality though is that it belies what happens when a layer of working class people improve their living standards say over or years we are led to believe that inequality doesnt matter because weve done alright what this does is break up the idea that we should have institutions in our lives health education housing which are paid by for all of us and serve all of us one trick by our leaders is to keep referring to terms like the kitty or in the pot meaning the sum of money thats raised through taxation as if that is the sum total of a countrys wealth meanwhile the rich and the superrich are salting away trillions but this apparently is not our concern its just a necessary part of how we improved our living standards over a two or three decades say in fact for a good deal of time its very hard to find out exactly how much this rich and superrich pot adds up to and even harder is to find out by how much it increases year on year

there should be a book on how to figure out boys except its rather difficult and i am sure it would be a very big book most guys would say they need a manual for girls but we are pretty easy to figure out and if you just listened you would know but if you ask a guy about their complexity most of my guys friends would reply back saying this standard answer oh us guys are simple creatures we live very simple lives yes off course you doso thats not true at all they may not need a lot to please them but they do tend to do a lot of stupid things beware guys perhaps you should take some lessons from girls people we are always watching you girls are always analysing its a very common thing to do among girls but maybe we do it a little bit too much sometimes which can lead to obsession that never ends well

the destruction that followed was horrifying millions upon millions of gallons of water cascaded through the strait flooding the basin of the mediterranean scouring the very earth as it rushed inward tarshish was not only drowned but uprooted from its foundations the kingdoms of the river valleys were flooded and destroyed there were however survivors who fled inland to smaller settlements bearing what elements of promethean society they could in the wake of the destruction heracles was hunted down and as punishment was forcibly possessed by the remaining priestking of tarshish who had managed to escape the drowning the black star was hunted and scattered throughout the land though shattered and diminished nephilim society survived spreading outward to establish the rule of the great compromise in new settlements throughout the mediterranean region however the last great dream of reestablishing atlantis had vanished forever
whats the solution an organisations culture is like its personality and that means its long lasting and slow to change fortunately we can turn to other theories and practices from organisational and social psychology to help we do know that influencing change relies on group dynamics and the norming and forming processes in essence its the story of if your friend jumps off the bridge would you do it as well theories of group dynamics actually suggest the answer is likely to be yes teams often have special tasks that isolate them enough from the broader organisational hierarchy that they have their own social structure and practices making them the perfect place to start introducing change

then just a few exits away on i the new jersey devils and philadelphia flyers are growing their rivalry with each game they are also tied and its anybodys guess who will win this series the flyers were definitely the favorite going in because of the way they took out the penguins in the first round but it doesnt look like the devils are backing down from a fight after periods of hockey last night the devils looked like they had given up but whipped out goals in the rd period to shock the flyers the flyers looked like a team that lost their way in the last period of the game and for that i would be scared

in other news ive really gotten into haruki murakamis norwegian wood it took me forever to get through the first book its separated into two volumes in the japanese version but near the end of the first volume i started to really like it and ive been speeding through the second one if you know anything about me and books youd know that i dont read ever so this is some sort of huge deal lol but that being said as i reach the end of the book i cant help but feel sort of sad and sort of reluctant to try and read more of it right now i could probably finish it tonight if i wanted to but do i want to deal with the sadness that comes with finishing a book especially because i know that the end of this one isnt particularly happy granted i guess its better to finish it at home than speedreading it in the train hmm though talking about reading in a train this book is filled with way more sex than i had originally anticipated which makes reading it on the train a little awkward haha well its either reading or fb for the next couple of hours so i guess ill try and get a few more pages in before calling it a night おやすみ

our saturday morning show being elmo a puppeteers journey was disappointingly lacking in the young folk hoped for as part of the docfest just past or the lumiere in sf or rafael film center in san rafael come december th or as my wife suggested perhaps the kids didnt want the magic of elmo ruined by seeing the man behind him the man that brought a voice and aesthetic to elmo that no other puppeteers were able to bring kevin clash definitely makes an effort to move his body away whenever he meets kids in real life as if his contortions are abracadabra gesticulations maintaining the magic the film is about a dreamer a geek picked on at school who works hard at his craft and eventually makes his way to the big leagues as well as the respect of his peers his parents support is endearing and tantamount to clashs success as is the public funding that contributed to clashs career trajectory besides the public television funding that made sesame street successful along with the massive research and talent that was part of the childrens television workshop that clash became a part of military research has a place to play in a particularly puzzling aspect of professional puppetry for young clash im going to be vague about it to allow for the pleasure of that reveal the public money behind elmo provided opportunities for artists and researchers to leverage their interests skills talents and dreams resulting in tremendous benefit for individuals communities and economies if youre cynical to the joy elmo has brought to so many children elmo did after all do more than tickle the economy in all the ancillary products sold

this is the most logical way to advance workplace protections because discrimination is a phenomenon of human attitudes and attitudes are changed through experience and personal growth not through the imposition of federal law discrimination based on personal characteristics is an affront to human dignity but creating federal penalties for discrimination will only spray perfume on one of the symptoms of discrimination without addressing the underlying cause

mandapanda posted a fantastic post this morning about band timelines and i so appreciated it everything she says is dead on i lost about lbs in my first year and then found out i was pregnant and am now months after giving birth back to that lbs i still have about lbs to go so im barely even way there like manda says it does get harder after that first year and you do have to work harder i am living that truth right now i also think that unless you exercise what is the point of getting the band you have to incorporate exercise it not only helps with the weightat loss but it helps with the loose skin and honestly its all part of the motivation for me ive been really frustrated with a lot of people on blogs wondering why they arent losing the weight or making excuses nonstop when they post the things they eat the fact that they arent exercising and have lost motivation uh duh there is your answer right there as many have said the band is just a tool you have to do the majority of the work there are so many other things i want to say right now about the many people seemingly optingoping for alternative surgeries those that actually have problems with the band which require them to have revision surgeries are not included in this btw i fully get there are many medical reasons to have to find alternative options due to erosion slippage etc but ill keep them to myself there are so many successful bandsters among us that have lost a lot of weight and have kept it off we are very lucky that we can draw motivation from their successes every day so please dont give up

i went to see c p taylors good at the royal exchange an adaptation of his novel and a tale of how a good man with good motives gets inadvertently involved with hitler and his henchmen to begin with i and my companions were entranced the production seemed wonderful with music and song and a brilliant use of the stage to create timeslippages that you dont often see in our generally overliteralist theatre but by the second half we were feeling that the frantic pace was preventing us from concentrating on the moral problem at the heart of the play and the way the transition took place from what i could tell that transition was very disappointing i was expecting a real revelation about the way that apparently moral precepts can be twisted to immoral ends which i believe they can but all that seemed to happen was that from the start the protagonist couldnt help acting out of selfish motives that belied his sense of himself as good and the outcome was thus hardly a surprise this didnt however seem to worry the rest of the audience who consisted a great deal of schoolchildren and who went wild with applause

because the story was told in multiple povs i never got attached to the characters a little bit but not much it switched around a lot i know some readers dont like that and sometimes neither do i but i think because of the way the book was written that it worked the book was told from kayla gabie drew and the villains point of view i think there were only four perspectives but i could be wrong so there were at least four different povs and i never felt particularly connected to the characters but i really wanted to know what had happened to kayla and if she was going to make it out alive

another cost thats often overlooked in the hand versus machine washing debate is the cost of the machines manufacture freight from the place of manufacture to where you buy it and then to home add to that the waste they become when they break down or wear out all these costs have to be weighed up and considered if you have a large family work outside the home and have little home time youll probably decide youre willing to pay the various costs if like me youre in a small family with occasional large family groups you might think the cost is too high and hand wash either way though its a private decision for all of us as always i dont expect you to follow what we do here i expect you to do what suits you and the way you work and be proud of that

the new testament scriptures only contain apostolic writings the collecting of the new testament scriptures started in the st century and was completed under the oversight the jesus apostles look at what the new testament clearly shows about the collection second peter confirmed that all of pauls writings were considered a part of other scriptures obviously pauls writings were being collected even before the new testament scriptures were complete and that these were being added to the previous canon standard collection of scripture all of pauls letters could not refer to every letter that paul ever wrote in his life especially those possible letters from when he opposed the christian faith this reference to all and the reference to other scriptures in this passage both refer the collection of every one of pauls inspired writings with other scriptures refer to the establishment of new additions to scriptures and a new collection the canon of the new testament now peter said that paul wrote unto you this is peters nd letter unto those presented in peter pet which was written to pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia peter said that paul wrote unto you and as mentioned before pauls letters were only to the ephesians and colossians in asia and to the galatians and not specifically to all of asia and to anyone in pontus cappadocia and bithynia evidently pauls letters were for everyone though first written to specific congregations this also shows not only the collection but also the distribution of the new scriptures in the first century as will be affirmed these other scriptures show that pauls epistles were being added to the old testament as well as the new testament collection progressively including the writings of at least four other new testament writers as will be seen the practice of collecting inspired writings and adding to the collection of the old testament had very easily been transferred over to the collecting of the new testament scripture

this morning former sunday tribune business editor neil callanan eked just a little more from the interview with the nama ceo and chairman last week and reveals in todays financial times that nama has had contact from middle eastern investors expressing interest in irish hotels with an aim to converting them into private homes and converting surrounding land into stud farms neil claims that sheikh mohammed bin rashid almaktoum of dubai owns seven stud farms in the country sheikh mohammeds brother hamdan has one and saudi arabias prince khalid abdullah has two nama exercises control over more than hotels in ireland and the hotel sector is generally seen to be suffering from overcapacity so some of these hotels may indeed find themselves converted to stud farms in the future
so i decided to makeover one of his old favorites in a vegan compassionate form most of the foods we like are not about the meat anyway its all about the texture and the spices and flavors we add to it in making a mock fish dish its important to get that taste that reminds you of the sea seasonings like old bay kelp dulce seaweed lemon and dill are good for that many people make mock crab cakes with tofu but that texture doesnt seem right to me tofu is too smooth tempeh is more substantial giving you that flaky texture reminiscent of seafood

manuel has been with me the whole term hes a bright goofball who amps up the goof hes the typical kid who is intelligent and tells me he wants to be serious in the class but then turns around and says something really dumb or gives me some lame excuse this is him the majority of the time its like he wants people to not take him seriously i tried cajoling him encouraging him and praising him in the beginning but once i realized that he was basically full of it i stopped it disintegrated into me giving him looks that said really when he tried to pass the buck as to why he didnt have his work i questioned him about how prepared he was for class until he admitted that he wasnt instead of the carrot i held the stick he required punishment in order to do his work finally i told him that if he did well in my class i would go to his next choir performance and cheer for him he paused how did you know i was in choir i shrugged i know lots of stuff youd really go he asked yes i will but you have to get your grades up im not going to cheer for a failing student then i offered my class a celebration at the end of the term if the y brought up the pitiful class average but in order to have it everyone needed to participate i stared at him

so enough about all of that and back to what makes this film so damn good the performances and the editing ill start with the performances all of which will certainly garner plenty of oscar nominations when the time comes hutcherson and wasikowska are excellent as the confused kids who try to navigate their way through the typical murky waters of adolescence joni thinks she knows what she wants but as we come to find out thanks to the interjection of pauls philosophies we see that she is really just doing what nic wants laser is more confused and hutcherson plays that confusion perfectly we have to infer a lot about laser since a lot of what hes feeling is nonverbal and cholodenko and her crew arent interested in explaining away emotions with needless exposition and hutcherson does a great job with the nonverbal acting without looking like hes mugging for the camera theres a great scene where he goes toetotoe with ruffalo where they have a discussion about team sports and the young actor hold his own in the scene even if it is totally ruffalos scene with his hilarious reaction shots what i like about their characters is that they act like teenagers they stay in the periphery and in the background a lot saying about as much as you would expect a and year old to say the real stars here though are the adults bening is bening and continues to remind everyone who sees her films that she is one of the ten best actresses working today julianne moore is always fantastic and here she is perfect as the neglected jules a woman who isnt sure what her path in life looks like and is in desperate need for her life to be shaken up this is what attracts her most to paul not that hes a man and that shes getting something from him that shes not getting from nic although in one of their fights this is what nic accuses jules of and her response is poingant and heartbreaking and brilliantly delivered by moore but that hes a dreamer too and that he listens to her and encourages her it doesnt even matter that pauls encouragement may be motivated by sex and it may not even matter that pauls encouragement his basically the same stuff hes been spouting since his philosophy days before he dropped out of college his first conversation with nic and jules about high education is one of the films highlightsits simply that his attitude his presence and aura are so much different than nics that she cant help but want to gravitate towards that its all explained in a sense near the end in a brief monlogue delivered by moore that is absolutley heartbeaking its a powerful moment and i was surpirsed that the cynic inside me was compleleyt melted dueing that moment and i have to give all the credit to the way moore delivers that speech not to mention benings reaction
everyone sees the litigation support departments future from their own perspective and function this is particularly true of firm management litigation practice group leaders partnershareholders and anyone else the litigation support personnel work for often little consideration has been given to how to develop or grow this important department or its personnel as an essential component of the litigation practice its your job as directoranager to articulate a vision and strategy for these group to see consensus with your key stakeholders and then to repeatedly communicate the departments vision and strategy to your customers and the people in your department who implement services whether you preach the vision and strategy or times the goal is to put everyone on the same page and keep them on that same page

the chumash seems to want to tell a story where the quran is more focused on explaining various conditions appearing during the life of muhammad true there are parts which relates to earlier prophets but the appearance of these parts seem to be provoked by either incidents needing them or questions about them see for example when muhammad reminds the children of israel of allahs former favors bestowed upon them and or relating to abraham and the quran is a constant dialogue involving its readers and reciters the chumash on the other hand relates a story telling about what happened to the preisraelite world in genesis and the israelites themselves exodus and onwards of course when the religious jew is studying the chumash he as much as the israelites being told about takes part in the incidents he is not outside but inside the biblical account he too was present when the israelite received the torah at mount sinai but this is the traditional way of relation to and studying the chumash based on interpretations of it

hesiod claimed that poets were in the service of goddess mnemosyne or memory once we set aside the religious framing of this idea we can see it is an accurate description of the social function of poets in ancient society the greek word for truth alētheia literally means nonforgetting the role of poets and oracles in greek society was to perpetuate the nonforgetting of deeprooted cultural experiences through their poetic verse
but then the far right who sees fear might be the vulnerable they would see change or a perceived change as a threat then their goal would be to dominate through legislation political dissent religious differences or even interpretations equality social and health issues and of course economic issues the candidates of are playing to this conservative base hoping that the results will lead to an election

but this past january the state diatetics and nutrition board decided cookseys blog diabeteswarriornet violated state law the nutritional advice cooksey provides on the site amounts to practicing nutrition the boards director says and in north carolina thats something you need a license to do its probably a safe assumption that most people dont pay much attention to diabetes issues unless they have it the only reason i pay attention is because im the only one in my family blood line that doesnt have type ii diabetes and im closer than id like to be if you dont follow it closely you wont know there is a massive schism between people who proactively attack their diabetes in an attempt to escape the complications virtually all amputations in the us are due to diabetes and the dietary recommendations of the american diabetes association the ada recommends a diet high in carbohydrate in the form of healthy whole grains but the folks who attack the problem have seems to me all learned the best treatment is a low or even zero carbohydrate diet the opposite of the adas approach while the ada recently published a magazine article saying in essence shut up take your medicine and do what we say the people following the alternate theory end up getting off medications and even off insulin like cooksey seems to me that has to be safer

there is a short article by charles mcmaster in the scottish brewing archive newsletter which traces the most salient points in the history of bells brewery but doesnt tell us an awful lot about the beer except that it was a strong scotch ale though no evidence for this claim is presented there is a rather odd description of scotch ale as strong and dark perhaps mcmaster was conflating the dark beers produced as scotch ale in the th century for the belgian market with the oldstyle scotch ale described by both roberts and booth as exquisitely pale

it is orson welles embellishments which make this film work it starts with the characters while ohara is as boring a protagonist as i can recall from a film noir and elsa despite being played by the gorgeous rita hayworth is also fairly runofthemill the attorneys are wellconceived arthur hobbles around on crutches from an unnamed ailment and george has a way of talking which sounds like the braying of a mule both are crosseyed and speak with an alcoholinduced slur throughout the film welles sometimes emphasizes this with the use of extreme closeups welles also has a lot of fun with the courtroom sequence at which point the film teeters into the surreal this includes a scene in which arthur is himself called to testify in oharas trial and as opposing counsel crossexamines himself of all the welles touches the most notable is the hall of mirrors sequence at the end describing it is difficult but it involves two people with guns and rows of oddly curved mirrors
