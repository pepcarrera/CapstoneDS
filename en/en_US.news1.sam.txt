q. i live in illinois and regularly attend st. louis blues home games. i drive over the poplar street bridge and take the exit ramp to th and clark streets. at the bottom of the ramp is a threeway light that operates on timers and does not have sensors to detect traffic. the green light for traffic on the exit ramp lasts only seconds whereas the green light for traffic on clark lasts well over a minute. prior to blues (and cardinals) games traffic backs up on the ramp and requires vehicles to wait for three or four traffic light cycles. these backups occasionally reach all the way to highway (interstate ) which creates a severe safety risk. i believe the city needs to put in traffic sensors at the threeway intersection which would extend the length of time for the green light for vehicles on the ramp thus improving safety and increasing traffic flow efficiency.

on the first earth day i was a junior at lewis and clark college in portland oregon and i remember spending some hours cutting weeds and cleaning trash out of a creek which ran near our dorm complex. it was a good feeling remembering that the planet does not belong to us but that its been entrusted to our care. i have a question. every day i see motorists who smoke while driving distractedly dangling their cigarettes out the car window haphazardly flicking their sinister gray ashes onto the roadways often carried away by the breeze. its been eons since i heard of vehicles coming equipped with ashtrays and why would responsible smokers light up with other nonsmokers in their cars. so my question is what happens to all the leftover cigarette ashes and twisted soggy cigarette butts? they dont go in any of the recology containers at least not the ones here in san carlos. all the butts and ashes where do they wind up other than wasting away on countless highways and byways?

page state medical examiner dr. karen gunson told jurors that collins bled to death from a gunshot wound to the left hip. she described the four bullet wounds he suffered and selfinflicted cuts to his neck. she also said she detected no odor of alcohol on collins breath or body during the autopsy. the fatal bullet passed through his pelvis and passed into the abdominal cavity. as it passed through the abdominal cavity it severed the larger artery called the "left iliac artery." that artery comes right off the aorta which runs down the backbone and "then it splits into the two iliac arteries that go down your legs. the bullet exited his lower abdomen. there were ccs of blood present in collins abdominal cavity and down the back of his pevic fossa the lower part of the cavity gunson testified. that would translate into a quart of blood. ( ccs is about one cup). "now generally speaking adult males have about ccs of blood in their body. and when you lose about a quarter of that or around a quarter of that acutely you will die from bleeding to death ... he bled to death internally into his abdominal cavity." a juror asked how long that would have taken. gunson replied that its generally " somewhere between seconds or a minute or so." another bullet entered the middle part of his upper right arm which fractured the humerus or large bone in the upper arm. the bullet exited the arm. a third bullet struck his left arm fractured the humerus or large bone in the upper arm and exited out the left upper arm. it was recovered in collins sweatshirt. another bullet struck just below his rib cage but did not damage any internal structures and exited out. the bullet apparently passed through the zipper of his coat and it struck "and that made it wobble in its flight." gunson said she couldnt tell which were the first two wounds and which two followed. collins had fresh selfinflicted cuts to the left side and right side of his neck. the cuts on the left side she described as "hesitation cuts" shallow cuts that dont go all the way through the skin. on the right side the cuts were deeper but he did not cut any of his major blood vessels gunson said. from her examination of collins body she said she could tell he had a mild heart attack in the past noting a scar on his heart muscle and possibly emphysema which could have impaired his ability to move around. toxicology test results were not available at the time the grand jury heard testimony. gunson said that takes three to six weeks to obtain.
